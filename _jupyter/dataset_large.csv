The Environmental Working Group (EWG) has rated some Tide products with an “F” due to their inclusion of toxic chemicals that can harm both humans and ecosystems.\n\nToxic Chemicals Found in Tide Detergents:\n\t1.\t1,4-Dioxane: Classified as a probable human carcinogen, this chemical is a byproduct of the manufacturing process and is often found in Tide products. It’s persistent in the environment and can contaminate water supplies.\n\t2.\tSynthetic Fragrances: These can contain hundreds of undisclosed chemicals, many of which are allergens, endocrine disruptors, or linked to respiratory issues.\n\t3.\tOptical Brighteners: These are synthetic chemicals that make clothes appear whiter but can cause skin irritation and are not biodegradable.\n\t4.\tSodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS): This surfactant can be harsh on the skin and has potential environmental toxicity.\n\t5.\tPreservatives like Methylisothiazolinone: Known skin sensitizers and allergens, these can lead to dermatitis and other skin conditions.\n\nWhy Choose Safer Alternatives?\n\t•\tHealth Benefits: Avoid exposure to potentially harmful chemicals that can trigger allergies, hormone disruptions, or more severe health concerns.\n\t•\tEco-Friendly: Reduce water pollution and protect aquatic life from toxic, non-biodegradable substances.\n\t•\tSupport Sustainable Brands: Many small, eco-conscious companies offer safer, plant-based, and effective cleaning solutions.\n\nI Encourage you to download the Healthy Living app to see the ratings of their household products, and please know you don’t have to compromise on safety.

mlm,"""Let’s be real.  Most network marketers don’t have a repeatable recruiting system that they can teach and duplicate. \n\nThe old-school strategy of posting more or sending more invites no longer works like it did before the pandemic. \n\nMost of the clients that come to me want to 2-3X their recruiting results. \n\nIf that sounds like you, I know exactly what you need. \n\nIt’s not that you aren’t good at recruiting, it’s that you don’t have the right system in place. \n\nRecruiting your dream team means being her Dream Mentor.\n\nThe best team members want to join the best leader. They don’t want to join somebody who doesn’t have a solid system to help them succeed. \n\nMy recruiting system will teach you to enroll 10 builders a month. You’ll onboard them with ease and plug them into your system so they can do the same. \n\nThat starts with getting clarity on how to create content to position yourself as her dream mentor and attract her to you. \n\nYou’ll learn how to create a comprehensive marketing strategy for both social media and email marketing to execute a scalable recruiting event. \n\nYou’ll learn my pre-launch and launch process to prime your audience for conversion.\n\nWe’ll co-create a high converting recruiting event.  And you’ll have a templated system to share with your team. \n\nYou only need 5 rockstar leaders to create a 7 figure downline. \n\nWhen you start implementing my recruiting system you will start building that dream team immediately. \n\nMy client Leeann has doubled her volume and her business over the past 12 months implementing my system. \n\nMy client Katie recruited 10 builders last month and earned a $50k bonus for rank advancing through duplication. \n\nIf you want results like these, this is the work I do with my 1:1 clients. \n\nInside my 1:1 coaching program, we work together to double your income up to 7 figures by focusing on recruiting, duplication and systems. \n\nWhether you’re a full-time network marketer who wants to scale your network marketing business, or you want to create your own offer, my 1:1 coaching was created for you.\n\nComment “ME” below or DM me to apply for a free mini-session to learn more."""

mlm,"""I want to share one thing that helped me successfully pivot multiple times in business. \n\nVision.\n\nSometimes known in our world as “the why that makes you cry” \n\nAnd there was A LOT of crying in those first years of growing my biz. IYKYK\n\nIt all started with a picture of what could be, fueled by a passion that it would be.\n\nI started that first business because I dreamt of a new life.  One with time freedom.\n\nAt that time, I had what most would consider to be a dream job consulting in leadership development, but I knew it was time for a change. \n\nA few years later, in the winter of 2019, I went away on a trip to the mountains with my family.\n\nI had that same feeling, like a shift was coming. \n\nI wanted to go bigger. \n\nI wanted to build a business that was even more aligned with what I felt God was calling me to do. \n\nThat December, I set what felt like an impossible goal of generating an additional $250k in the next year. \n\nI outlined all the reasons why it was important to me. \n\nHow we would be able to give at a higher level.\nHow I fly my mom and sister first class on a dream spa vacation. \nHow this would allow me to invest in coaching + growth events. \n\nI wasn’t exactly sure how I would do it, but I had created the vision and was praying for the next step. \n\nWhen I came across a life and business coaching certification, something clicked. \n\nI knew it would support my personal growth and help me to become an even better leader. \n\nI took a risk and invested $18k in the program.\n\nThat is how my current coaching business started. It was more of a passion project. \n\nWhen I shared about my certification, people started reaching out to me to coach them.\n\nIt took on a life of its own. \n\nSix months later I was coaching a full practice and had made an additional 6-figures. \n\nBy the end of the year, I hit my goal. \n\nGod doesn’t need a crowbar, but you have to have the willingness to dream big, create a compelling vision, and be courageous to take the next best step.\n\nIf this resonates, comment VISION and I’ll send you the link to my free training on creating and leading yourself with a compelling vision."""

The only night I’ve ever spent away from Ry is when I was in the hospital to have Brae. \n\nI hate being away from my girls. That’s why I started this business in the first place. I wanted to contribute to our household financially, but without having to leave them for 12 hours at a time twice a week. \n\nI truly believe God put this opportunity in front of me for a reason. And I know He has a plan much greater than me. \n\nTomorrow I leave for conference to elevate my business. I’ve prayed and prayed for days because I’ve been a wreck. The thought of leaving my girls makes me sick. I know they will be safe and well taken care of with their Daddy and Gigi, but it doesn’t stop thought of being away from them. \n\nI took a leap of faith to start this business, and now I have to take another leap of faith to trust that my girls will just fine and I will make it back home safe to them.

I’m so excited to get home to my sweet girls and my husband 🫶🏼 and of course my mom, I’m so thankful she was able to come stay and help with the girls! I know they loved it. \n\nAs I sit here, reflecting on the last 48 hours, I can’t stop thinking about how much God has worked in my life recently. And in ways I would have never expected. \n\nI never thought I would be traveling to Vegas, especially not on a trip to elevate my business. I never would have thought I would even had my own business, and a successful one at that. \n\nI think sometimes we just get so set in our ways. We become almost narrow minded in a way to what we are capable of. If you would’ve told be 6 months ago I would be in network marketing, I would tell you that you are absolutely crazy. If you would’ve told me that I would be making $10,000-$20,000 a MONTH, I would have told you that you are literally insane. \n\nBut that’s where I’m at. That is what I have accomplished in just a few short months. All because I put aside my fear, my doubt, and my ego and I took a leap. I invested in myself and in a business that I knew had potential. I believed in myself that I could make it happen, and I did. \n\nI know it sounds trivial for me to say “oh it’s so easy” because I am sitting here with success, but it really is. You just have to apply yourself. And the potential is literally sitting there, waiting for the taking. \n\nI may not be saving lives in the way I’m used to, but I am changing lives.

They can’t even fathom the idea that $5,000-$10,000 is the low end of monthly incomes in high ticket. \n\nIt’s such a crazy concept for people who are used to working crazy hours for a paycheck to paycheck life. \n\nSo here’s the thing, consistent $20k months, or more, is a thing over here.

I made it a point to be intentional and put myself in a better mindset. \n\nIf I’m being honest, I haven’t plugged into myself or my business much this month. I just needed a regroup. Both personally and professionally. \n\nThat’s the beauty of this business. That’s both the beauty and the hard truth of entrepreneurship. It’s not always sunshine and rainbows. You’re not always going to want to show up for yourself. And that’s okay. \n\nThis “off” month for me. This month of not always showing up, I still managed to rank up. In this off month, I’ve still made more than I ever did as a nurse. Even in my crazy Covid overtime days. \n\nEven on the hardest day, I know I am still living the life I dreamed of.

And I didn’t even realize to what degree until I took a step back. \n\nI was not the nurse I wanted to be. I didn’t take the time I wanted for my patients. I walked out of every shift disappointed and exhausted. There was so much dissociation. And when I did feel, it was overwhelming. I thought my last pedi code was going to take me out of nursing completely for a minute. \n\nI realized my burnout was trickling into every aspect of my life. My marriage, my kids, myself. \n\nI look forward to shifts now. It adds value to my life. It isn’t my whole life. It isn’t all consuming. \n\nTo the burnout nurse, I see you.

Same if you don’t really have a credit history yet.

mlm,"""I absolutely love being a nurse, which is why I will never walk away from it entirely. I started my high ticket business because the nurse math wasn’t mathing. I was spending hours away from my family to barely make ends meet. Which in turn was leaving me feeling burnt out in all areas of life. As a nurse, a mom, a wife, even a friend. \n\nMy business has given me the answer I needed. I can now juggle all my roles the way I need to. And I’m no longer “just making ends meet”. I can now make my entire nursing income in ONE sale. \n\nI’m not a millionaire, yet, but financial freedom without sacrificing my family is amazing. And now I also have the ability to help other women wanting to balance mom life, wife life, life in general, and bringing in an income to do just that! \n\n✨$1250-$7800 per transaction \n✨NOT an MLM\n✨No deranking or starting over EVER\n✨Amazing support and mentorship\n✨$0 down options \n\nIf you’re ready for your answer, meet me in the DMs 🫶🏼"""
mlm,"""It’s the FIRST day of the LAST month of the YEAR!! 2023 was HUGE ✨ My life changed this year & I am helping 3 more incredible women change their before the end of the year! If you are ready for change, if you are ready for $10,000-$20,000 every single month, the change is for you! If you are over sacrificing time with your family for an income, this is the opportunity you NEED! DM and let’s change your life mama 🫶🏼"""
mlm,"""You know freedom is? \n\nBeing 7 days into December and already having made over $5,000 this month alone. \nBeing in control of my schedule, so when I wake up and think, I think it’s a cleaning day, that’s what I do. \nBeing able to help other women find themselves again, find their purpose outside of being a wife and a mom. \nBeing able to help those women never have to choose between income and family again. \n\nThis is ✨Freedom✨ \n\nI am taking on ONE more business partners through the end of this year. You and I will work one on one together to get you to SIX figures in SIX months 🙌🏽 \nWhy wait for your New Year’s resolution? Why not start your journey now? \nYou could be making multiple 5 figures by the New Year 🫶🏼 DM me"""
mlm,"""Meet my pal Julia 🫶🏼 \nShe’s a badass to say the least. \n\nJulia is a mom of 3, a wife, and a BIG time entrepreneur. She’s done a little bit of everything but knew she wanted MORE! \nA year ago she was drowning in debt and working 4 jobs to make ends meet. \n\nIn less than a year she’s scaled a multiple 6 figure business, cleared over $50,000 last month, and she made $2,500 yesterday on a daily contest. Yeah, just a daily contest. \n\nThat’s the incredible things that can happen in this business. It’s not too good to be true, it’s just that not everyone is willing to step out and own their own business and put in the work. \n\nAre you willing to invest in yourself? Are you willing to put in the work and stay consistent? \nIf so, then you can have this too. So what’s stopping you?"""
mlm,"""Sometimes I take these moments for granted. Holding her meant the laundry had to wait. The grocery shopping has to wait. \nIt can all wait. \n\nThese are the moments I will never get back. These are the moments that I will look back on when they’re all older and don’t want mommy snuggles anymore. \n\nThis is why I do what I do. My nursing career will always be there. And yes, I’ll go back to it at some point because I love it. As crazy as it sounds. \nBut right now, this is what matters. Being a present mom. Having the time for my babies. Not having to sacrifice an income while I’m doing it. And showing other mamas they’re capable of it too 🫶🏼 \n\nYou can do it. Just have a little faith in yourself. It doesn’t always have to be a sacrifice. I’m working with one more deserving and ready woman this year. So what are you waiting for?"""
mlm,"""“Look Mommy you got more checks!!”\nHeck yeah I did baby girl! These are the best kind of mailbox runs 🫶🏼\n\nI never post these things to brag or boast. I hear often though “that must be nice” or “that’s just too good to be true”. The truth is, it is nice, but it’s not too good to be true. \nThis business takes putting skin in the game, dedication, and consistency. But with that little bit of uncomfortableness and a few hours of work a day, it also provides an incredibile opportunity and real freedom. \n\nFor me, that freedom is not having to sacrifice my income and my identity to be able to stay home and raise my kids. Freedom is not having to pick up extra shifts to cover Christmas or extracurricular activities. \n\nWhatever freedom looks like for you, it’s within reach. It’s not too good to be true, if you’re willing to put in the work. And it is nice. \n\nI’m here for you. Let’s talk 🫶🏼"""
mlm,"""Over the last 7 months I have learned to trust. I have learned to trust myself, trust those who has paved the way and guided me, trust the process, and trust in God. \n\nEntrepreneurship is a journey to say the least. It means getting uncomfortable, taking risks, and learning all kinds of new things. You’re going to have to hold yourself accountable. You’re going to have to show up for yourself even when you want to stay in bed. You’re going to have wins and losses. But when you get to the other side, whew 😮‍💨\n\nIt’s so worth it. \n\nDon’t go into another year doing the same thing and expecting it to change. Don’t stay unhappy just because it’s comfortable. Have a little faith and trust yourself. You’re capable of so much more than you realize. Just because you’ve never done it before doesn’t mean you can’t do it now. \n\nLeap. You’ll thank yourself later. And I’ll be right there with you. Six figures in six months anyone?"""

So getting back to reality now, I realize that I live in reality I don’t need an escape from. \n\nI’m not back to some job or more 12 hours shifts. I’m just back to daily life with my kids, talking to incredible individuals daily, and building with my team. \n\nThankful doesn’t even begin to describe the feeling of where I’m at. This is what people talk about when they say answered prayers. Stepping back and trusting in God has given me more than I can even fathom. \n\nMy team has done over $50,000 in sales this month. In a month where family and life are the focus. \n\n2024 ain’t even ready. This year is going to be one for the record books.

And being at home all the time can be a lot sometimes. But honestly, I know I’m going to miss this and be so incredibly grateful for this time. \n\nBeing able to have a business I can do from home, or anywhere, with my kids, it really is the biggest blessing. God knew what He was doing when He put it in front of me. It’s been worth every penny of investing and every ounce of time I’ve put in. Especially when you can literally pull 5 figures it one day. \n\nI’m telling you right now, if you’re on the fence, get off  and take the leap. You won’t regret it."""

Some days I look like Adam Sandler with a shirtless baby and a dirty mirror and messy house 🙃 \n\nPeople always ask me “How do you do it with kids?” “Am I going to have time?” “How do I make time for my business?” \nThis business is so incredibly flexible. Today is the first day of 48 hours at home alone with the kids. Today I decided to take calls because honestly my team is overwhelmed with people ready to change their lives and take control in 2024! So it’s calls and paperwork today! \n\nI can literally work this business with my kids in my lap. Now don’t get me wrong, I have to prioritize. I have to designate time for play time, calls, grocery shopping, and time to clean house. But working this business into my daily is doable. And it’s a priority for me! \n\nIf making $5k, $10k, $20k, $50k PLUS a month and claiming your freedom is a priority, you can do it! Are you ready to make a change?"""

Being able to get the heck out of the house and do things! \n\nI hear so many SAHM say they don’t leave the house because it’s expensive, and I HEAR you!! I’ve been there. But let me tell you, being able to leave the house to go to target or go to the park is so incredible for my mental health as a SAHM. And being able to spend the money sometimes without the stress or a guilt is icing on the cake 🎂 \n\nI’ve said it before, but just so you know mamas, you can’t have your cake and eat it to.

I do have my hands full. \n\nBut ya know what, I get to raise my babies while they’re little. And despite being busy with them I made the decision for more. 8 months ago I started my high ticket business so I could earn an income from home while raising my babies. \n\nSome days it’s hard. Like when pregnancy takes it out of me or when the girls miss nap time. But it works. I have all the flexibility I need in my business, and still while making more than I could have dreamed of making as a nurse. \n\nIt’s a priority for me. It was a no brainer from day one.

Unfortunately mom couldn’t find a pet friendly Airbnb for 2 labs, so they had to stay home and our amazing neighbor is hanging out with them until we make it back over. \n\nThis is a pain. I’m not going to lie. It’s stressful, it’s frustrating, I feel bad leaving our dogs. It’s not what we planned for at all. \n\nThe silver lining to this is true financial freedom. Financial freedom isn’t always something glamorous. Sometimes it’s just being able to adjust to what life throws at you. \n\nThis happened to us last year on Christmas. We stuck in out for 5 days with no water. And then had a big expense with our well. Talk about stressful. \n\nThis time around we are waiting it out in a beautiful Airbnb. And didn’t even have to think twice about it. That’s real freedom. \n\nAnd a year from now, maybe we just plan a trip to Texas and stay the heck away from this 😍 although it’s cold there too right now lol. \n\nIt’s 2024 and we’re not staying stuck or complacent.

mlm,"""I know there’s plenty of yall out there that will question me or doubt me. That will question or doubt this business and what it’s capable of, but honestly, that’s your loss. \n\nIn 8 months I have created a multiple six figure business and helped so many people absolutely change their lives! \nI have done this while being a mom to two toddlers, being a fire wife which means a lot of time on my own,  working PRN as nurse, teaching dance, being a volunteer FF for medical calls, and for the last 5 months being pregnant. \n\nI had no experience. I’m not a sales person. I just saw the opportunity of a lifetime and I RAN with it! I believed in myself and fully knew what I was capable of. I didn’t make excuses, I put the work in and continue to everyday. So I’m going to pat myself on the back a little, because I deserve it. \n\nIf you want something bad enough, you can make it happen. If you put in the work, you’re going to reap the reward. \n\nI am working one on one with ONE more person this month.

This business isn’t meant for someone looking to “try” something. \nThis business is for those looking to level up. For those who have both goals and motivation and won’t allow for failure to even be an option. This business is for those who refuse to stay complacent and stay stuck. \n\nI am only looking to work with people that want it as bad as I did. There’s no room to half ass it over here. It’s all in.

We do things like go on family outings on a Monday. \n\nI’m a few months away from the arrival of our baby boy. There’s no stress of maternity leave. There’s no time limit.

Oh and it’s day 1 of a 48 without Dad 🙃\n\nHaving a business that’s ACTUALLY flexible is key to making this work! I make my schedule. I can work anytime, from anywhere.

I have more goals to hit, more successes to gain, but this mama is feeling successful and happy right now. \n\nI think I like this little life 🙌🏽\n\nI am taking on 5 new business partners now through April. You will work one on one with me to build your empire and create a multiple 6 figure business in 6 months. Don’t wait!

mlm,"""I put my phone down for the weekend. \n\nThat’s what “taking off” looks like for me these days. So I put my phone down. My friends and I threw one of our friends a baby shower, my mom came to town, we worked on little man’s nursery, my nene and Aunt came over and helped with painting. Oh and my dang tire blew out lol. \n\nToday I’m spending the day with my mom and my girls. Doing all the things we need to feel more prepared for little man and I guess go get my car fixed lol. Oops.

It’s time mama, so let’s talk. 🫶🏼"""
mlm,"""So I was sitting down this morning going through our monthly bills and expenses, making sure all the payments were set up and squared away. \n\nLess than a year ago, sitting down to do this was the most stress eliciting activity possible lol. It involved spreading out payments, always minimum payments, scrimping and saving to budget, and never even making a dent in the debt despite my husband breaking his back and working 2 jobs and me working 2 12s a week. \n\nNow we are debt free. One trip to the mailbox pays the bills. Now we’re focused on saving, getting to enjoy life, finally accomplishing the much needed things around our house and property, and focusing on the things that really matter. \n\nIn this economy, I know most people are experiencing the first. Stressed and stretched thin trying to make ends meet. \nThat’s exactly why I do what I do!! That WAS me!! But I had to do something different. And now I get to show others a way. I get to show others how to earn their worth and create an income stream that takes the stress away. That makes life easier and changes everything. \n\nI am taking on only TWO more business partners to coach to six figures in six months until June!! DM me STRESSED and let’s take care of that 😉 ￼"""
mlm,"""Walking to the mailbox. It usually entails stacking the bills for the month right? Well I still have those too, but one mailbox run also pays all those bills for the month now. And those bills don’t include mounds of debt anymore either. What would an extra $10,000-$20,000 a month do for you?? How would that change things for you??

Your return is your money that you earned, that the government kept and didn’t even pay you interest on. \nDon’t settle for that. That’s not the goal babe. \n\nThe goal, the win, is to have that return amount coming in EVERY. SINGLE. MONTH. \n\nWhat if you were bringing in $10,000-$20,000 a month EVERY. SINGLE.

So I didn’t have to spend 12 hour shifts away from our kids & working opposite shifts from my husband and never seeing him. And all just for a mediocre income.

My husband was quite literally breaking his back for us. \nWe found out we were pregnant, and it was twins. And we cried. A lot. \n\n10 weeks later we lost them. There was so much guilt. Because we never even got the opportunity to be happy. We were just stressed. \n\nWe both knew in that moment, we had to do something different. So we did. \n\nTwo businesses later, and less than a year later, we are on our way to take our maternity photos. Our son will be here very soon and our family will be complete. \n\nWe are so happy. We are finally ahead. \n\nMy point is though, I get it. I get all the shit. I get all the fears. I get the feeling of being in debt and the thought of investing in a business feeling absolutely terrifying. But we did it. We started TWO businesses at the same time. Yeah it was a lot of money we didn’t have, but ya know what? It was worth it. It was our way out. It was our way to control. \n\nStop telling yourself you can’t.

I work from home. On my own time. With full control of not only my time, but also my income. \n\nI make no less than $5,000 per transaction at this point in my business. One walk to the mailbox is almost equivalent to the entire 12 weeks of maternity leave pay I had.

I am so thankful for the people, the friendships, the community. \nOver the last few days we have all come together even more, working to create something amazing for our entire team and those that join us in the future. \nIt’s incredible what can happen when people truly come together! \n\nIt’s more than high ticket.

Like really be their mom that they need all the time. So that’s my focus right now. \n\nI am incredibly thankful that my business allows me to do that and still have an income. Because especially in light of recent events in our lives, we quite literally wouldn’t be surviving without this.

If you’re in NWA, you should definitely be shopping at Little Black Boutique! She even puts on trucker hat parties!! \n\nAnd after all that I came home to a mailbox full of 100% passive income. Having a business that continues to work in the background for me has been crucial for me in my busy last 2 months. \n\nThey always say, learn to make money while you sleep 🤷🏼‍♀️ \nI don’t sleep much, but the fact I can live life freely is pretty dang cool"""

All the expenses we’ve had, doctors appointments, PT twice a week, trying to give the kids a fun summer. It feels like everything is falling on me right now. And like I’m driving everyone around 24/7. \n\nThis business gives us the flexibility we need right now, and makes those expenses painless. \n\nSo even though my plate is overflowing right now, I am so thankful I have been able to work for my team to give them what they need for success.

mlm,"""Every time I get on TikTok I see people trying to monetize on that platform. And rightfully so. \n\nThe push to earn an income from home is HUGE right now. Especially for moms. \n\nChild care is crazy expensive and puts a lot of parents in a position where childcare is more than they can even bring in. Hence why there are so many SAHMs. \n\nThis is EXACTLY why I ended up in my business and why I help other moms to get here too. TikTok is great, but it takes a large following to even be eligible to monetize. Which takes a lot of work. Then you have to keep up with your content, branding deals, etc. to actually monetize. And every creator will tell you, it doesn’t last forever. \n\nI teach moms how to utilize social media and monetize on social media with a tangible business that has longevity. Similarly we are creating content but without having to have a large following. As you build your business and your network, you can then monetize in more than one area. \nThis business also provides health and wealth for the long term. This includes getting to a point where you have LEGACY income! That means not only you getting paid for life, but passing that on for your children to be paid FOR LIFE! \n\nIf you’re looking for a way to not only make an income from home, but make a substantial income from home that sets you and your kids up for the long run, it’s time for us to talk. I mean can you imagine passing $10,000 PLUS a month FOR LIFE to your kids?? \n\nDM me MONETIZE and I will show you our $50k passport to not only making money online, but doing it for the long haul 🫶🏼"""

There’s hundreds of vehicles on the lot, but not a single one of them is going to drive itself. \n\nYou have to invest in the one you want, commit yourself to it, grab the keys, turn it on, and drive it. Along the way you will have to maintain it, fuel it, and maybe even repair it. \n\nThe vehicle does absolutely nothing sitting on the lot. And even if you take it off the lot, it’s not doing a thing for you if you don’t maintain and fuel it. \n\nThe point is… be the few that make it.

That’s why I help other women get that too! \nIt’s not the solution for everyone, but it sure is for some. \n\nMy girl Josee told me from day 1, “I’m staying home with my son and I’m going to make money doing it!” \nHer and I have been working 1 on 1 together for the last two months, and she is doing just that!

mlm,"""Listen, you’re looking at it all wrong. \n•\n•\n• \nI am not some inspiring person who has accomplished something unattainable for most. \n\nI was the person who despite thinking I was doing everything right. Did it all wrong. \nI went to college, got my nursing degree, had a good job. \n\nI got married, bought a modest house, and started having babies. \n\nAnd that good job quickly became not enough. The payment for my student loans took up an entire paycheck. \n\nLong story short, despite having “good jobs” as a nurse and firefighter, we couldn’t afford childcare, 12 & 24 hour shifts were hard to balance and we were drowning in debt. \n\nSo after hitting rock bottom and having asked family for help, I knew I had to make a change. \n\nI invested money I didn’t have into a business I knew nothing about. \n\nThe driving force though was “well if they can do it, so can I” \n\nThe only thing standing in your way, is the belief in yourself. I could have easily gotten discouraged. I had no experience, no following on social media, no idea how to use social media, and genuinely didn’t even know where to start. \n\nWith the right training & mentorship and the willingness to learn, you can be successful. It was a big learning curve for me and a lot of ups & downs. I was told no so many times. I had people telling me I was dumb, I was in a scam. I got all the hate. \n\nI didn’t make a dime for the first almost 2 months. I had a business to pay for and no revenue. But I kept at it. I learned, I grew. I developed new skills. And I started seeing what was possible. \n\nI have a built a 7 figure empire over the last year, and I don’t say that to brag. I say that to tell you, if I can do it, so can you. \n\nIn the last year alone, on top of raising 2 toddlers, I got pregnant and had a difficult pregnancy. I had an emergency c-section, a baby in the nicu, my husband wrecked his for wheeler and broke his back, and I have gotten down on myself more than once. But even with every excuse to not, I focused on growth. \n\nYou don’t have to know it all. It doesn’t matter where you come from. If you want more, if you want to see success for yourself, you can. \n\nIf I can do it, so can you. \n\nLet’s chat 🫶🏼\n\n#growth"""

It’s time to take matters into your own hands. \n\nStop relying on the people paying you the bare minimum to change things for you. \n\nIn 2022 I made $28,000 as an ER nurse working 24 hours a week.

mlm,"""The Top FIVE Things to Look for in a Business \n•\n•\n•\n1. Mentorship. Starting a business always feels a little less scary when you have support. Someone who has been where you are and can help you and give you tool through all the ups & downs. Especially if you don’t have experience. That was me. I had no clue what I was doing, so that guidance was key! \n\n2. Sustainability. There are several opportunities that offer short term results, but few that offer a sustainable product & long term solution with growth potential. The brand deal and the affiliates are short term. If you’re investing your time & energy into something, you want it to last. \n\n3. Value. You want a business that is worth it. What is your ROI? And not just financially but you want to get a return on your time as well. It’s more worth it to invest more money into something if it pays for itself, puts a significant amount in your pocket, and gives you your time back. You want to see the value of it in its entirety. \n\n4. Time. Yes, I’m talking about it again. Because time is your most valuable asset, so don’t waste it. You don’t want to put time into something that is just going take more time forever. \n\n5. Duplication. You should be your own brand. So you want a business that you’re able to customize & also duplicate. It’s great to have success once, or for one person, but you want growth potential. You want to be able to maintain for yourself & ultimately for others to ensure growth all around. If it can’t be duplicated, it’s not sustainable. \n\nFollow along for more tips & finding your solution 🫶🏼\n\n#wfig #sahm #womeninbusiness #entrepreneur #nurse #momboss"""

mlm,"""It’s really easy for something to get a bad rep honestly. \n\nThink about encountering someone super religious and judgmental. And you get a bad taste in your mouth towards God. \nGod isn’t bad. God is good in every way all the time. \n\nBut often people wrapped in religion get the “holier than thou” complex, when in reality, that’s not how God wants us to be at all. Paul teaches the Jews this in the Bible. \n\nJust because you are “religious” doesn’t mean you’re like God. Being like God would be to be welcoming and showing others the way to overcome sin. \n\nMaybe you had a bad experience with something in your life and you immediately thought “oh yeah that’s the worst”. \nIt may not be the thing that’s bad. It’s the experience. \n\nI see this a lot with sales. A bad experience with sales, like an overly pushy person who makes you feel icky and uncomfortable. And then you ward off sales entirely. \n\nAnd I get it. I didn’t buy a Ford or Lincoln simply because the guy at the Ford dealership was so awful. It was a negative experience that put a bad taste in my mouth for those vehicles. \n\nOn the other hand, I had a great experience at the Chevy dealership and it made me not only purchase my car, but want my husband to look at GM trucks. \n\nMy point with all of this, your experience matters. It shapes your entire decision on the thing as a whole. \n\nI had seen countless MLMs, digital marketing, and  network marketing opportunities over the years. But like many, I knew of people that had built businesses and never really made much or it all came crumbling down. \n\nI said it would never be me…\n\nHaving a business in the online space has been the best decision I could have made. I strive to not only give others a great experience, but teach the skills and tools needed to do it right. \n\nDon’t rule out an amazing opportunity because of a negative experience in the past or an idea of “oh yeah those things are all a scam”. Open your mind to a new experience. Because you never know, it could be the thing that changes your life. \n\nAnd don’t rule out knowing God just because someone wasn’t that great who said they knew Him. \n\n#sahm #nurse #entrepreneur #firewife #momboss #girlboss"""

But the third servant, out of fear, buried his gold and let it sit. In the end, he was called “worthless and lazy” because he didn’t use what he had to flourish.\n\nThe lesson is clear: To those who have, more will be given, and they will have an abundance - Matthew 25:30\n\nTrue abundance comes when we take what we’ve been given—our talents, our resources, our opportunities—and invest in them. We’re called to grow, learn, and multiply the gifts God has placed in our hands.\n\nI believe in my heart of hearts that God has called me to help others do just that—to guide them toward the abundance He has for them.

All while supporting her husband with ranching! \nShe has built a strong team of women and truly putting in the work to help them succeed! And even bringing on a GLOBAL business partner. \n\nShayna is a single mom of FIVE who went from government assistance to building her own 6 figure empire and being able to FULLY provide for herself and her kids! She has proven time and time how dedicated a leader she truly is! And her team is making moves! \n\nMarikka is a mom of 2 and an ER nurse. She’s cut back to part time and more than tripled her nursing income. But more importantly, her coaching skills have absolutely FLOURISHED! She is so dedicated to her team and their success! They have produced over $80,000 this month alone!! \n\nWho you go into business with MATTERS! Success does not come easy, and it’s true, a lot of people fail in business. Many don’t get to where they want to be. \n\nThat’s why you HAVE to have a solid foundation. A solid business plan & model. You need quality resources, training, and guidance. \n\nThat’s what we offer here. Mentorship and coaching that is UNMATCHED.

It cited Isaiah 51:12 & Galatians 1:10. \n\nPeople’s judgements and opinions are not that of God. And theirs don’t matter. \n\nThe secret to success is to outlast your critics. Follow God and His calling for you. It’s the long game that matters. \n\nI put my phone down, closed my laptop, & opened my Bible.

mlm,"""Monday is my favorite day of the week ☺️Has been ever since I left my office job I was soooo miserable at over 5 years ago. Back then Mondays were absolutely dreaded because I was working for someone else’s dream and didn’t have the freedom to do things outside the box. Monday meant the beginning of a 5 day stretch doing something I was not at all passionate about. Somehow we’re conditioned to think it’s normal/okay to hate what we spend the majority of our waking hours doing....? Never made sense to me. After losing my mom so suddenly it really taught me to look at every day as a gift and cherish & appreciate each moment. Going through a terrible loss like that opened my eyes to something so much bigger then myself and made me take action of things that weren’t serving me. It helped me remove negative people and things from my life that weren’t bringing me joy. My entrepreneurial spirit didn’t jive with following someone else’s agenda, deadlines and goals. I was craving something of my own. Over time and through having experience in successfully owning and operating my own business(es) I’ve grown to really love and look forward to Mondays and what they bring. I love that Monday equals a chance for a fresh start, new beginning and the opportunity to design my week in the way that best serves me. I’m grateful I get to paint the life I desire and take full ownership of my journey. This morning I got to start my day doing an amazing yoga class in the Dana Point Harbor! Thank you @maggiegyogi and @iheartyoga_org for being a constant positive in my life🙏🏼 In just 7 Mondays from today Wade and I are getting married at this beautiful venue 😍🙌🏼 It’s fast approaching & I’m so excited!!

mlm,"""This man often seems too good to be true. I am eternally grateful to be his wife and do life together. To love this fiercely and unconditionally is the best feeling I’ve ever experienced. Everyone deserves a deep deep love like the one Wade and I share. I’m a big believer in manifestation and boy oh boy did I manifest Wade as my husband! It wasn’t easy lol and it took over 5 years from the time I started manifesting until we finally became man and wife (this included a long distance relationship for a couple years and me getting so fed up with barely seeing each other I finally took a big risk and moved across the country to Boston so we could be together. The first 6 months of living there I still ran my business remotely [I owned a smoothie/juice bar franchise for several years]. It was extremely challenging to run a brick & mortar business from 3,000 miles away so I sold that and took on every job you could possibly think of over the next couple years including but not limited to {software cold calling 🤢 probably my least favorite thing ever, temp work, waitress, nanny, real estate agent/business broker etc) but every single day and all the struggles were so worth it to get where we are today. If you’re reading this and wondering if there is someone out there perfectly designed for you - I promise you there is✨You might need to take some risks and do things that are crazy uncomfortable to get you there but I did it and you can too. It didn’t make sense while I was in it and I kept questioning what the hell I was doing and hoping it was all going to come full circle. It did. I wouldn’t have it any other way. Every experience built character and I met incredible people along the way 💙 I have come to learn you will only find greatness in life when you step FAR outside your comfort zone and are willing to sacrifice what yourself and others might think of you to go after what you really want🍀💕 #onetruelove #getoutsideyourcomfortzone @wellnesswithwade I love you 😘"""
mlm,"""Living life by MY design has always been my “dream job”. I had always longed and searched for something that would allow me time freedom to work around my schedule but I couldn’t find it. I imagined a magical job where I could be surrounded with people who lifted each other up, encouraged one another, were advocates for positivity, paying it forward and making the world better. A place where breathing belief and love into one another was part of the daily do. I’m a yes girl by nature so being present with my friends & family is a non negotiable. It’s absolutely necessary for me to be present for all social gatherings like birthdays, showers and destination weddings etc. With the amazing circle of people I have in my life it would be impossible to balance my social life with a typical 9-5 job. In the past when I’ve worked in a corporate settings where I was to stick to a very strict vacation schedule I often pissed off the HR department because I was bending the rules too much for their comfort. I would have to submit requests for time off and they’d often get rejected. I remember when I went through the tragic and sudden loss of my mom I got 3 days of “bereavement” yup just 72 hours of paid time off and then I was expected to get back to the grind. Nope...that life is not for me. We get one life people!!! Live it the way YOU desire! If you can dream it you can do it ✨Being able to work from home (or anywhere) on your terms is truly a dream come true. I did it & so can you. My job is literally to coach and train people to start their own health & wellness businesses and I am pretty dang good at it!

mlm,"""Someone asked me the other day “What is it like working from home?

No two days are the same as an entrepreneur but it’s always full of excitement and sometimes even unexpected surprises 🥳 (mostly good but sometimes not so good) #truth. So to answer her question...this is what today looked like.

mlm,"""I’m looking for 4 special people who are ready for the greatest self growth journey I know of. Could it be you?! Or someone you know?! On May 17th 2019 Wade and I got the incredible honor to walk across the stage at our company’s Global Training Conference in Vegas in front of over 18,000 Arbonne Independent Consultants as we got celebrated for promoting to the third out of only four levels of management in Arbonne. It’s safe to say Arbonne takes really good care of their leaders. I started my business on August 4th 2018 after noticing a huge shift in my body/happiness/mood/anxiety/overall health thanks to Arbonne’s 30 Days to Healthy Living. I began sharing it...word of mouth advertising works and almost everyone is looking to get healthier so it caught on quick. I promoted to the Regional Vice President (RVP) level about 3.5 months later on November 20th 2018. It was my dream to promote the day before Thanksgiving so I could sit with my family on that wonderful holiday and feel peace & thanks over all the hard work it took to get there. Yes...I promoted fast because I wanted it almost more than I could breath. Before Arbonne I did not like what I was doing for work. In fact I quickly grew to loath it. It was unfulfilling, I was not passionate about it and I felt like I wasn’t making an impact in this world. So I created a plan to make Arbonne work for me, my leaders coached me, poured into me daily and showed me how to take the fast track to achieve my goals (all while balancing another job). It was an intense period of life. I want to stress that it is not a race and not everyone has a fast journey, in fact most people don’t do it at my speed but it shows you want is possible if you want it bad enough and are willing to do what it takes. Earlier this year, after originally just being in the business alone my husband and I decided to join forces and he officially partnered with me. (Continued in comments)"""
mlm,"""Never in a trillion years did I think I’d do something like this. I had fears and hesitations like “what will people think of me??”...”what if network marketing doesn’t work for me”... “It sounds too good to be true...if everything I’m seeing online is real why isn’t EVERYONE doing this?!” I’m a big believer that things come into your life in the perfect time & space sequence. One year after starting my journey with network marketing all I can say is I love who I’ve become and I wish I did this sooner. I had heard about Arbonne 5+ years ago but I didn’t “get it” back then. Today I finally feel like I have a purpose, like my mom is watching over me more proud than any sequence of words could ever make sense of, like I’m a leader, like I’m making a difference, like I’m proud of my profession and get paid what I’m worth. I’ve never had a job I really liked that much. I dabbled in real estate selling businesses, I owned a franchise juice bar for 4 years, I waitressed, I nannied (probably the only thing I thoroughly enjoyed), I did cold calling for a software sales company 🥴 (prob worst gig of them all-had to do 175 cold calls a day omg NOT for me but mad respect to people who do it well because I was seriously depressed and highly anxious working in that environment). Of course I still have fears and there’s still close friends and family that have never once shown an ounce of interest in my business, never once come to an event, tried a single product let alone a sample or even asked me a question about what I’m up to but I keep smiling because I see where I’m going and the future is SO BRIGHT!! 😎 It’s hard to imagine it can get better than this but we’ve barely scratched the surface!! I know this business isn’t for everyone but I’m grateful it has retired my husband at age 30 and we get to work on this together. It’s truly a dream. I’m grateful we get to live our life by our design-everyone deserves that. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines and are ready to begin helping others with me I’m your gal. You CAN do what I do. You CAN create your own ripple effect. All it takes is stepping out of your comfort zone. Slide into my DMs for more info 💚"""

We even did a powerful guided team mediation with energy queen & light activator @sarahashleywheeler to visualize how we will be ending 2019 and walking into 2020!

When was the last time you gave your gut the reset it deserves?? 🤔\n\nIf you’re looking for an opportunity to get 1 on 1 coaching via a clean eating program, all these incredibly pure products at 40% off to support 2 of your meal replacement shakes a day, shopping lists, recipes to cook delicious meals & a Facebook acountability group that’s basically a mini nutrition course - THIS IS YOUR SIGN ⚠️. My next group starts this upcoming Monday Sept 2nd & after that my next group is Monday Sept 16th! I coach groups through this the 1st and 3rd Monday of every single month! \nYES you still eat foods 🥬🥑🥦🍋🍠🥕🍓🍏🍆 and lots of them! There is no calorie counting or tracking! This is not a diet or a weird fad way of eating. You eat two delicious & nutrient packed shakes and 1-2 meals a day (depending on your goals). We eliminate anything that’s inflammatory, acidic, allergenic or addictive to detox your gut and get your body to an alkaline state. After the 30 days most people adopt what we call a 80/20 lifestyle where they eat clean 80% of the time and 20% of the time...treat yourself 🥳! This program changed my life; it taught me to have a healthy relationship with food which is priceless. If you have any signs of toxic overload which you can see on the 4th picture you can start your healthy journey & join me in the next group! The last photo is my before/after with living a healthier lifestyle & implementing the knowledge I learned thanks to Arbonne’s 30 Days to Healthy Living! This is NOT a weight loss program because I’ve had plenty of clients who maintain their weight, gain weight or even build muscle. It is simply a CLEAN EATING program that teaches you principles and guidelines you can use to be the healthiest version of you! You will learn so much about ingredients, nutrition labels (how to read them), what foods serve you & which ones don’t! If you are carrying around extra toxic sludge/weight (like most of us do) your body will melt that off! \nIf you’re ready to commit to your health and need an accountability buddy...I AM HERE FOR YOU☺"""
mlm,"""How cute is my little office?! It’s small but it does the job! 💚This time last year Wade and I were living in a 1 bedroom 1 bath 800 square foot apartment and both working from home. It was TIGHT and we both worked in the common area or sometimes I’d have to work from the bed or the balcony because he’d be on conference calls and I couldn’t focus being near him-not always ideal! Fast forward to now...I am so grateful for our first home and that we both have our own offices! Homeownership is sweeeet and it’s really fun to make a space feel your own 🏡🥰 I just walked into my work space and felt overwhelmed with gratitude of how much my life has transformed over the past year so I felt compelled to snap a pic and document this. I dreamt of a day I’d be able to design my life, work from home, have a flexible schedule, not have a boss to answer to or dictate my work hours, Wade would be retired from corporate finance and we’d be partnered together in my global health & wellness biz and he’d have more time to focus on his passions! These dreams have come true-it wasn’t always easy but its been well worth it! We’re working on some other exciting dreams now and I already feel them manifesting 👏🏼Thanks for listening folks- I hope YOU are having an awesome week so far!! ✨ #shebelievedshecouldsoshedid"""

mlm,"""What an HONOR! ✨✨✨ I am still buzzing with insane energy & adrenaline from yesterday. Wade and I got recognized and congratulated in front of almost 3,000 people for not one...not two...but three big achievements we’ve accomplished in our business. We got to walk the stage at Pure Impact in Long Beach and be awarded for being #4 in top region volume (highest team sales) and #2 in top region sponsoring (meaning our team helps the most new preferred clients get hooked up with pure, safe and beneficial quality & nontoxic products and new independent consultants get their business started and up & running successfully). I had no idea we were going to be celebrated until I got an email from corporate a couple weeks ago letting us know. This company continues to surprise me, impress me and spoil me. It feels too good to be true, like I’m living in a dream. None of this would be possible without our incredibly loyal customers and our amazing team so THANK YOU- you know who you are! Your continued trust, love and support means the world to Wade and I. I love helping others- it truly is my love language so calling this a job feels silly because it feels so natural. I truly am just a normal girl whose life changed through doing Arbonne’s 30 Days to Healthy Living and decided to pursue the biz! If I can do this ANYONE can do this! I got dozens of messages yesterday of people asking me questions about the business and how it works. Let’s get your questions answered- private message me and we can set up a FaceTime or if you’re local I’ll treat you to a juice or tea! If you’ve been watching from the sidelines and are curious to join us know there is room for everyone at the top ☺️"""

mlm,"""Can you carry on even when it’s hard? These girls can! It’s not always easy. Entrepreneurship is HARD! It can be emotional, it is often times a roll-coaster, it is truly like no other “job” you can find but it is the best decision I’ve ever made! Ever since I was a little girl I’ve had an entrepreneurial spirit. I remember at a young age LOVING having lemonade stands 🍋(one time I made $80 in like an hour I remember thinking I was set for life haha), by middle school I was dropping off flyers at every house in the neighborhood advertising my babysitting services (no experience but thanks to that move I legit had dozens of kids I babysat for years)🤣, by age 23 I owned a popular juice bar franchise located in San Clemente and now I own a global health and wellness business with my husband. Not everyone is designed to be their own boss (and that’s okay!) but if you have an entrepreneurial spirit and don’t know where to start...let’s talk! Network marketing is the way of the future- I recently heard a study that said in the next 3-5 years over 50% of households are going to have their own home based businesses! It’s not brick and mortar anymore...it’s click and order baby! I welcome any and all conversations around business ownership and how you too can join the movement! We’re all doing it...if you want to...you can too! I’ll lock arms with you & show you the way exactly as I have with these fine ladies (men welcome too!) ☺️✨"""

mlm,"""wow, wow, wow. I swear things don’t happen by accident. Just a few moments ago around 10:30 pm on 10/08/19 I stumbled upon this 2 page letter to myself. I wrote this exactly one year today. I wrote this little letter to myself and I read it every single morning for months. This is my why. This is my promise to myself to continue building this legacy even when it feels impossible. I looked at the date on the top right hand corner and noticed I wrote this a exactly a year ago and it made me so emotional to think how far I’ve come in 12 months. My life has changed so much in a year. A year ago we weren’t married yet, I was very unhappy in an un-fulfilling job, I had an unhealthy relationship with food & admittedly drank too much alcohol, had some toxic people in my life that were weighing heavy on my heart but I wasn’t strong enough to walk away, Wade and I were living in a one bedroom condo my dad owns and let us stay in for free so we could save money and I was just starting to get comfortable with dreaming and seeing what Arbonne could do for our life. The opportunity almost sounded too good to be true but I trusted the process and did what the successful people before me (my incredible up-line) coached me to do. So thankful that I did 🙏🏼 1 year later; Wade and I are happily married, proud homeowners in a gorgeous neighborhood, I am surrounded by positive and supportive friends and family, both Wade and I are retired from corporate America FOREVER 🙌🏼 and our thriving team is making such massive ripples in this company. Reflecting on it all it’s downright incredible what we’ve created. \nThis journey has not been easy by any means but it has been worth it, it has been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done and I feel proud of myself. I love who I’ve become and want anyone desiring more out of their life to know that if I can do this ANYONE can do this (or whatever else your heart desires). Go for your dreams people, you are worth it ✨"""

mlm,"""Are you living your life on purpose?! Today Wade and I finished a book. It was a 40 day read. We read one chapter a day for the past 40 days. Reading together every morning is my favorite way to start the day. Beginning our morning in alignment has made day to day life feel so much more intentional.\n•\nThe beginning of chapter 40 said ~ ✨Living on purpose is the only way to really live. Everything else is just existing.\n•\nMost people struggle with three basic issues in life. The first is identity: “Who am I?” The second is importance: “Do I matter?” The third is impact: “What is my place in life?” ✨\n•\nAre you really LIVING or just EXISTING?!\nIf you’re struggling with knowing your identity, your importance or your impact~ I’ve been there too and I urge you to know it’s part of your journey. It’s just a stop on the way and you won’t be there much longer. If you’re not struggling and you are already living your life on purpose ROCK ON!!!\n•\nTrust that you are exactly where you need to be 🙏🏼 & whether we personally know each other or we’re online buds I’m always an open book and here to talk. I love getting to know people and their stories on a deeper level! ☺️"""
mlm,"""This man, Stian Mørck is someone I really really admire. His beloved late father Petter Mørck founded Arbonne International back in 1980 in the town of Arbon, Switzerland🇨🇭(which I LOVE so much given my Swiss roots). That’s where our company name comes from- Petter added another “n” and an “e” to make it sound more feminine and boom 🌱”Arbonne”🌱was born!\n•\nWithout Petter’s vision and what has been carried on now for nearly 40 years Wade and I wouldn’t be living the life of freedom that were are. Neither would tens of thousands of other people. GRATEFUL isn’t a big enough word for the eternal gratitude we have for Arbonne. It has truly been a life changer for us.\n• With a simple “Hey we both live in Laguna- we’d love to get to know you better. Wanna meet up?” voice note to Stian we made it happen! We heard about what it was like growing up in a home with a father who had such an incredible vision. A vision for creating a pure, safe and beneficial botanically based skincare company in a multi level marketing channel. Creating a win-win; happy customers for life and an opportunity for ordinary people to build a home based business. It was so cool to hear how the company started and from day 1 has always had incredible values and the nontoxic approach, has grown globally and evolved into what it is today. I love our company culture and that upper management takes time to get to know field leaders. I will always remember this special day! Thank you Stian🙏🏼💚\n•\nIn Petter’s words, “Arbonne is a place where ordinary people do extraordinary things every day to enhance not only their own lives, but also the lives of so many others.”"""

mlm,"""If you know me really well you know I have a fear of water (especially the ocean). I don’t like being in bodies of water (even pools). I can totally swim it’s more so a fear of being out of control/out of my element I guess (I’m also fearful of sharks and pretty much anything that could ‘get me’). Anyone that has ever pushed me into a pool or thrown me off a boat/water toy etc has seen the sheer panic that comes over me. It’s paralyzing and truly one of the worst feelings ever for me. Anyway, today I voluntarily ran in the lagoon and spent a couple minutes in there without any scary feelings 🤗. It felt so freeing & cleansing👏🏼 Proud of myself for getting out of comfort zone! \n#feelthefearanddoitanyway #facingmyfears"""
mlm,"""You ever gone for something so huge it scared the sh*t out of you? You ever gone for it FULL FORCE and believed with your whole heart you would smash it? You knew it was happening/ you declared it to everyone...You ever felt it to be so real it was basically already yours...and then you missed it? And then you felt shame/embarrassment and all the negative self talk. Yea, that happened to me last night. I let myself have a big fat pity party filled with lots of ugly crying but I’m over it because that’s no way to live and I have SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR! I would have been over the moon to achieve the goal I set for myself by a particular deadline but I know this is prepping me to be a better leader. This is prepping me to relate to others that go through this same thing. I woke up today so proud of having our biggest month ever and for giving it my ALL! No stone left unturned. Pretty sure every single person in my entire network knew I was going for this. So proud I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and went for it. So proud of my team and the milestones they are hitting 😭🙏🏼. It’s truly amazing. A LOT of lives touched by the movement we are creating. That is some serious exponential growth and it all started with my “yes” and my bravery to run with this business so I’m very proud of that. So often we set our goals too low because we are afraid of failure or afraid of what’s going to happen if we don’t achieve them. I would much rather set a big goal and miss it than set it too low and blow past it realizing I could have gone much further if I had set a higher goal. I really believe that all leaders (and all my mentors) have felt what I’m going through and I have two choices: to give up or to keep going! My choice is to keep going because the reason I started this business in the first place and my WHY is so much bigger than any obstacle I will ever face and I KNOW I will smash this goal when it’s my time! Thank you to all my friends, family and supporters! You know who you are!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you ⚡️"""

We all met through social media/“six degrees of separation”. We’ve grown and are continuing to grow strong & stable businesses alongside each other. ✨\n•\nChecking in with each other every day, supporting, empowering, loving on and inspiring each other daily, coaching clients through our healthy living program, helping teammates start build their own businesses, lifting each other up, impacting our communities, influencing our networks with the common mission of spreading joy/inspiration/health/happiness, changing lives, diving into personal growth, being coachable, filling our minds with trainings from legends who have done it before us, reading, making a difference, giving back, paying it forward, spreading a ripple of positivity throughout our circles etc these are just a few quick things that come to mind when I think of our “job description” and what we do everyday as successful network marketers. ✨\n•\nThe people, our amazing community, our company culture, our mission, the personal growth & development, the sisterhood, the friendships, our best in class products, I thought it was all too good to be true...until I stopped watching from the sidelines and jumped in to see for myself! ✨\n•\nI’m sharing this because I was sooooo desperately looking for this and never knew it was available to me. It truly terrifies me to think what my life would be like if I didn’t dive in. I craved everything Arbonne stood for but didn’t have a CLUE what it really was.

To me; that is the most rewarding “job” in the world. I’m grateful every single day that I was offered the gift of Arbonne and will forever proudly share it.\n•If you keep doing what you’re doing (especially financially) where will you be in 5 years? What will your life look like? Are you prepared for impact? I know I wasn’t before Arbonne came into my life and the 5 year question really scared me. I quickly realized it’s smart to have a second stream of income/side hustle/plan B/whatever you want to call it!\n•So what’s holding you back? Fear of failure? Scared of rejection? Scared of what people will think of you? (That was my biggest fear when I started. I thought ‘oh my gosh what will dad think of me’) Don’t think you’re “the type” to be successful in network marketing? Think you don’t have enough time to build something substancial?

These people are joyful, they are thriving, they are grateful, they have an abundant mindset, they are passionate, they love their job or whatever business they are in, they are making a positive impact, they are money magnets, they have great energy, they attract healthy relationships & happy marriages, they have a happy home life/ healthy family connections and they all have the same thing in common ~ they did what was HARD. They got through the deep hurts, the pain, the struggles, the hurdles, the setbacks, the challenges, the times of being tested because they knew their was a better way and that they were worthy of it 🙏🏼\n•\nHad I realized this simple concept YEARS ago I could have saved myself from some serious hard stuff that came up in my life but I didn’t know any better. I did what was easy because that’s what most people do 🤷🏼‍♀️ it’s all part of my journey and for that I am forever grateful ☺️\n•\nOverarching takeaway: You are where you are today because of the choices you made yesterday.

I was devastated for a good month (finally starting to feel good again) and it took a fat blow to my ego. BUT I’M BACK and I have the momentum to give it my all again. This goal is so important to me because I can only show others how to build to the top of the company if I’ve done it first. I am ready to pave the way. I’m excited to bring teammates to the top level with me and be in Maui Jan 2021 as new National Vice Presidents TOGETHER.

It takes time, effort and activity to build your Arbonne Business, so however much or little of these factors you choose to devote will determine your income and success levels. You can benefit from building a team- whether you want to focus on or expand your personal sales. The more you help your team grow their sales volume (by focusing on improving sales with their Clients), the more you will be rewarded as you move through the SuccessPlan.\n\nIf you want to learn more about building an Arbonne business send me a private message and we can explore what that would look like for you!

I was put on earth to leave people better than I found them. I was put on earth to deal hope to people who were once lost like me. I was perfectly placed here and now to use my gifts. To be a powerfully magnetic force field of love and unity. \n\nI can wholeheartedly say I found “it”. I think most people go through their whole life and don’t find it. I’m so grateful I trusted the process, LEANED IN and felt the fear and did it anyway. In the deepest part of my soul I believe it would be selfish to keep this gift a secret which is why I’m sharing it with YOU. This journey has not been easy or glamorous. It’s tested me to my core, it’s been full of unexpected surprises and even some heartbreaks but I would do it again and again to be exactly where I am today...\n\nIt brings me to tears to reflect on the version of me a few years back that was so insecure, so lost, so desperate to step into her purpose, who was craving a vehicle to make an impact, who knew she was ‘made for more’ but had no idea where to start...\n\nI leave you with this: you are exactly where you need to be & there is room for you too💜\n\n#trusttheprocess #arbonne #bonbabes #arbonnelifer #lifer"""

mlm,"""🌟Calling all network marketing professionals!! 🌟\n\nRegardless of what multi-level marketing company you work with I believe it is ESSENTIAL to become a student of the industry!! Be teachable, be coachable, plug in, find a mentor to model after, become a sponge & soak up as much knowledge as you can...\n\nIf we haven’t met yet hi 👋🏼 I’m Sandy! I am a proud independent consultant and Executive National Vice President partnership with my husband. I never in my wildest dreams envisioned I let alone we would be doing this for a living....but when I learned what was possible I decided to bet on myself and give it my all. My whole heart and soul. I dove in. Not with one toe, not with two- all ten toes!!!! I was the ordinary girl that decided to go for it. It’s changed my whole world. and the best part is....YOU CAN DO IT TOO! \n\nWhen I’m personally coaching new business builders to launch their global online health & wellness business with @arbonne I ALWAYS recommend these four books to start. In my mind these are MUST READS and staples to help build confidence in the industry & help you speak more eloquently about the opportunity you’re offering!!\n\nIf you’re in network marketing and you haven’t read these...what are you doing??? Get on it!!! 🤓📚\n\nThe amount of private direct messages I get from people asking me for advice/some tips/ or my favorite 🤣 “what’s your secret” on how to build what I’ve built is honestly hard to keep up with!!! There is NO secret or shortcut!!! This is called netWORK marketing...it’s WORK!! Part of why I’m posting this is so I can easily forward it to every person who asks where to start haha but also cuz these are great simple reads that I want y’all to know about!!\n\nI’m no different than any of you...I just did the hard things (over and over again). I committed to the unsexy things day in & day out!! Remember, you are only recognized in public for what you consistently do in private...what are you doing consistently in private?? My advice to MLM consultants, reps, distributors is to make sure READING is something you are doing DAILY (did that soak in...DAILY) to build your belief, your confidence, your leadership skills & your mindset!! ⚡"""

I look forward to these calls every month but today was extra special because of all we’re celebrating! \n\nMaybe you’re wondering, so Sandy what is a B Corp?\n\nThey are the best way to build credibility, trust and value for business. They are businesses that meet the HIGHEST standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability. Arbonne is one of the Top 25 largest companies worldwide to be a Certified B Corp. It is a very intense process to become a Certifed B Corp. I shop from Certifed B Corp whenever possible because ultimately we VOTE with our dollar and where we spend money matters! \n\nOur mission is to help people flourish with sustainable healthy living. What I love about us is that it’s not only about being the best company IN the world but it’s about being the best company FOR the world! We balance people and the planet over profit! Most companies are a C Corp and care mostly about Profit and don’t have a plan in place to balance people and the planet. At Arbonne, we believe that when people and the planet are taken care of ~ the profit will come! \n\nIt’s the perfect time to become a part of this with me. \n\nIt’s time to lock arms with me and make a positive impact on the world! 🤩 What are you waiting for? \n\n#Arbonne #Sustainability #BCorp #ArbonneForGood #bcorporation #zerowaste #zerowasteby2030"""

I get choked up thinking about my story and how much my life has evolved over the last couple years.\n\nOn August 3rd of 2018 I was at a point in my life where I was desperate for change and was so eager to know my purpose. I knew I was made for more but I felt stuck and my job was sucking the life out of me. I asked my mama for a sign 🙏🏽👼🏽I will forever remember this moment. I had been overthinking and contemplating for weeks if I should join Arbonne. My gut health had been transformed by the 30 days to healthy living program and I was naturally sharing the products with everyone but too insecure to actually sign up as a consultant and DO the business.\n\nI was so scared, I had so many fears and doubts. I was terrified of what people would think of me but something was still tugging at my heart to go all in. I literally out loud said, “mom if I am meant to run with this opportunity please give me a clear sign. If my yes will impact thousands of people’s lives and have a ripple effect globally please show me and I’ll give it my all” \n\nLITERALLY THE NEXT DAY I GOT THE SIGN I HAD BEEN WAITING FOR 😭😭😭😭 she gave it to me so clearly. A white rose has always been a symbol that my mama is with me. I was literally handed a white rose the next day at the close of an inspirational Arbonne event and I felt chills run down my entire spine.\n\nThat was the day I DECIDED #arbonnelifer \n(Keep reading in caption)"""

The person you will become along the way as a network marketing professional will transform you as a human in the best way you can imagine. LEAN INTO the hard times and embrace the hurdles!! There will be hard times and hurdles but there will be even more purpose, joy, adventure, fun, freedom, time flexibility, personal growth and work-life balance than you’ve ever had\n\nI’m going to start sharing more business tips and things that have worked for me along the way!

Second, leave your wallet at home as its all inclusive. Third, you are surrounded by the most EPIC people.

mlm,"""I started my health journey via Arbonne 4 years ago. I had ZEROOOO intention of ever doing the business side of things at first. I just wanted the products. At a discount. I wanted to feel good, wanted to focus on better sleep, clearing up my skin, having better energy, maybe shedding a few Lbs but did NOT want to be approached about the biz. Or so I said…I loved the products so much I was recommending them to people left and right. I realized one day Sandy you ARE DOING THE biz without getting paid…\n\nWhy?\n\nCuz I was scared.

I didn’t have time freedom or flexibility in my schedule. I was CRAVING that…I saw networking marketing and the opportunity with arbonne as a genuine aunthetic way to share my health transformation and help other people do the same. Of course with a competitive earnings comp plan attached. I saw it took the average National Vice President 5 years to get there and average monthly earnings of about $22,000/per month.

We’re here to show you what’s possible through the four levels of management in Arbonne.\n\nEveryone starts as an Independent Consultant, it only costs $49 to get your website setup and start your Arbonne business.\n\nTo earn your first ~$500, work with your upline to produce your first ~2,500 in volume. \n\nThe comp plan is built off of 2,500 building blocks.\n\nThe first of four levels of management is District Manager. At this level you are earning between ~$200-1,000/month. This is a range and this is totally efforts based and depends on the each individual business, as it does at every level hereafter.\n\nThe second level of management is Area Manager. At this level you are earning between $1,000-3,500/month based on your business. At this level your business also becomes WILLABLE. Something you can pass down generations.\n\nThe third level is Regional Vice President. At this level you can earn up to an $800/month success award towards any white Mercedes Benz of your choosing. The average monthly earnings are ~$4,000-9,000, depending on the size of your business.\n\nThe fourth and top level of management is National Vice President.

I don’t miss the days where Wade would be working 12 hour days in the office and I wondered what his day was like. I missed him. And then he’d come home and I’d leave to work the night shift waiting tables and serving drinks until 1/2 am. Hot damn has life changed since city living in downtown Boston. It felt like we were two passing ships in the night. Feels like another life now. That was only 5 years ago…A LOT can change in a short amount of time when you have a dream and take inspired action.\n\nI knew there was another way…It’s been a journey!! A transformative process. An unlayering and rewiring of my belief in myself. The ultimate personal growth path and redefining what success means to me and what we are capable of but DAMN has it been worth it. \n\nSince we’ve partnered in entrepreneurship it’s been the greatest thing for us and our relationship. Building our businesses together has brought us closer, helped us majorly with our communication and overall closeness.

For us it was the vehicle that changed everything.

How her suddenly and unexpectedly passing without getting to say goodbye made me want to live a life to make her proud. Made me want to take risks and live bigger. How I knew in the deepest part of my being when I was introduced to Arbonne that this could be the thing that changed my life but I was soooooo scared of what people would think of me. I was scared of failing. Of being made fun of, ignored, losing friends…all the headtrash. \n\nOver the past decade I’ve worked daily on healing the scars on my heart and through so many limiting beliefs.

mlm,"""There’s a HUGE difference between a Professional and an Amateur.\n\nThis remains true in the network marketing profession. \n\nWhen you’re a professional, you aim to transform, to change peoples lives, you focus on them, on how you can help them, on solving their problems, on helping them grow. \n\nAn amateur focused on themselves, what’s in it for them, they are transactional, they’re going for the sale, and people aren’t interested in buying from you to help you. People want their problems solved. \n\nSo go change peoples lives in this profession and you’ll be wildly successful. \n\nTranscript:\n\nWe’re on a walk and we just had a realization. So there’s a big difference between a network marketing amateur and professional. Most people that join network marketing are an amateur and they stay an amateur. They try and sell you product or like they don’t really they aren’t all in on it. It’s sleazy, it’s creepy, it’s what gives network marketing like that kind of like feeling where you’re like oh here they come. A network marketing professional changes your life. It’s just simply that a network marketing professional changes people’s lives. You just leave it at that.

mlm,"""How to avoid stress at work:\n\n1. Don’t go to work.\n\nFunny but there’s truth in jest. \n\nNothing wrong with a little stress in our lives. Stress on the vibe produces the best wine. \n\nBut if you’re stressed from work because you work in a job that you don’t like and can’t see yourself doing 10 years from now then you need to make a change. \n\nI wasn’t necessarily constantly “stressed” when I worked as a VP for a finance firm, but I wasn’t passionate about it and certainly wasn’t long on it. \n\nI realized spending 40+ hours a week doing something you don’t enjoy and don’t want to do for the next 30 years until you can “retire” puts stress on your soul. \n\nI legit consider myself “retired” because I enjoy what I do and the lifestyle it provides. I don’t look forward to the end of what I do - aka retirement. \n\nSo if it’s on your heart to seek a new career path, I encourage you to explore that!\n\nIf you like what you do for work, rock on!\n\n#work #workhardplayhard #tulum #stressrelief #lifestyleentrepreneur"""

We were baby best friends as Wade’s Mom and Sandy’s Dad went to high school together in Wayland, MA and randomly both ended up in Laguna Niguel, CA and pregnant with us!\n\nWe obviously became baby best friends, and the rest was history. Haha no it’s a much longer story than that, but that’s a story for another day.\n\nWe’re newly a family of 4! We have two beautiful daughters, Cameron North Critides (20 months) and Cove Golden Critides (7 weeks). They are the absolute lights in our life.\n\nWe just moved from Orange County, California to Littleton, Colorado in March 2023 and are LOVING the Colorado energy and lifestyle!\n\nCareer wise, Wade took the more standard route, set his sights on business school, ended up getting his Master’s Degree in Finance, and went into the corporate world with his eyes on the prize: earning a six figure salary and being SET.\n\nSandy was more a born entrepreneur. She was willing to try things, and go for what she was passionate about. She also got a degree and worked in a corporate setting, but realized that wasn’t for her and decided to chase her passions. Health & wellness, helping people and building community.\n\nAn opportunity stumbled into our life to partner with a health & wellness company called Arbonne, initially through a 30 days to healthy living clean eating program. It benefited Sandy so much, she had to learn more about what this community and business opportunity was about. She immersed in the community and went to an event and realized this was the opportunity she was looking for, that would help her express her gifts and she could make an impact while making an income. \n\nCaption is now too long you’ll have to read the rest by swiping the pic!\n\n#ourstory #lovestory #thecritides #lifestyleentrepreneurs #familyof4"""

mlm,"""Ever feel that burning desire to get the f*#k out of the rat race?\n\nIf yes, I can relate. That was me just a few short years ago. \n\nI found a way to escape, through what I like to call lifestyle entrepreneurship in which utilizes key assets you have access to: your network, a turnkey e-commerce model, social media if you choose to, and a little bit of good old fashioned hard work.\n\nI realized there’s nothing in life quite like knowing your purpose and waking up every day and moving towards it. \n\nThe great thing is you don’t need to know your overall life’s purpose right now, you can choose to do something more purposeful, that will likely move you closer to your purpose. \n\nI realized my life lacked purpose when I was sitting behind a desk, or working from home at my desk, working for someone else, in something I was not passionate about and in something that I had no vested interest in beyond getting my paycheck every two weeks. \n\nI wanted purpose, I wanted passion, I wanted impact, I wanted exponential growth in myself and my ability to make money. \n\nI don’t know if I found my life’s purpose (yet), but I know I’ve found something that feels purposeful. \n\nI now feel like I make an impact in peoples lives. I help people get healthier, I help people start businesses, find community, grow as an individual and a leader. \n\nIf you’ve been seeking something more purposeful in your life, I don’t think it’s an accident you’re reading these words right now. \n\nI can help you start a business TODAY, in the e-commerce health & wellness space and help you feel that sense of purpose, direction and growth. \n\nShoot me a message and we’ll connect from there. \n\n#purpose #jetsetter #purposeful #lifestyleentrepreneur"""
mlm,"""One day we decided to stop saying “One day we’ll start an e-commerce business” and we made that day, day one. We started an e-commerce health & wellness business with a brand called Arbonne for $99. We got a great discount on products we were already using and loving and it felt easy to share them as they had helped us so much. \n\nThat yes to that side hustle turned into our career ~18 months into our business. We worked it hard, part-time, after our 9-5s. Sandy was a business broker, she was able to leave that ~3 months after she started the business, I joined her 6 months into the business and a year later was able to walk away from my six figure finance job to pursue lifestyle entrepreneurship full time. \n\nNow we get to travel the world, create our own days, design our schedule and life, and do something that feels fulfilling to us. \n\nIf you’d like to learn more about if this could also be a fit for you, we mentor 3 people per month to start their own business. Send us a DM “Online biz” and we’ll go from there. \n.\n.\n.\n.\nOur story isn’t typical, but it does show what’s possible.

mlm,"""This girl slide into my Instagram hidden request box last year (September 2022). She shared that she was a consultant in arbonne 7 years ago but as she’ll describe it “gave up on herself”. She continued loving and using the products but stopped working the business. She plugged away at her corporate job and did very well for herself but every year for 7 years she would watch arbonne consultants who started when she did continue to promote, grow, travel, earn these amazing incentive trips and evolve into the happiest version of themselves. She wondered what her life could be like had she stayed.\n\nLong story longer she interviewed @wellnesswithwade and I on a zoom call to ensure she’d want to partner with us as her leaders 🤣 lol I love this ballsy approach cuz that’s not really how this works but hey~ It felt like a mutual fit and we decided to partner. She’s worked very hard, been extremely coachable. Mich has a growing thriving team and countless accolades including recently promoting to Regional Vice President (top 2% of the company) and earning this unbelievable incentive trip the @atlantisbahamas . Her organization and the momentum she has stirred up is extremely inspiring to thousands of people around the globe.\n\nOver the past year since starting she’s completed an Ironman race, been dumped by the love of her life and fired from her corporate job BUT because of this community and amazing opporuntiy is truly thriving amidst so much crazy life stuff happening!!

mlm,"""I used to think network marketing was a scam too so if you fall in that camp…I get it. It’s time to get educated and understand how legit this business model is. It’s not going anywhere it’s just going to keep growing. This isn’t just the business model of the present but of the future 📈\n\n1st of all pyramid schemes are illegal so if you’re still trying to fight that battle it’s over 😭 stop wasting your energy trying to defend your point. A pyramid scheme entails getting paid for signing people up (which we do not) and does not involve an exchange of product (which we do). We ONLY get paid in the exchange of product. So CLEARLY Arbonne is legit and has been for since we were founded over 43 years ago. It’s rare I get an anti-mlmer coming after me any more but when they do I just laugh 😂 bless and release baby I got nothing to prove!\n\n#ilovearbonne #mlmbusiness #mlmsuccess #arbonne #discoverarbonne #atlantisbahamas #bahamas🇧🇸"""

mlm,"""True story I took several public speaking classes in high school & college (even majored in speech communication) because I wanted to become a confident speaker but it didn’t come natural. I vividly remember having a nervous breakdown before one of my speeches. For weeks leading up I had so much anxiety and literally drama going on with my tummy (anyone else majorly ruled by their gut😅💩🚽?!) cuz the thought of presenting in front of a live audience made me feel so uncomfortable and sick to my stomach.\n\nI was sobbing in the hallway with my professor moments before it was my turn to present; hyperventilating literally gasping for air, sweating perfusely and visibily shaking. She was trying to calm me down and having me focus on my breath but I was so terrified of judgment from my peers nothing was helping…There was an old school VHS video camera 🎥 set up in the back of the classroom ready to record the whole thing. She felt bad for me and compromised as she could see this was not something I wanted to do so she let me present facing the white board with my back to all my classmates. It was not good by any means but I did it and I remember feeling extremely relieved when I sat back down.  My heart breaks for that version of Sandy cuz her self esteem was so low.\n\nIt’s wild to think that was only about 12 years ago and how much I’ve grown. \n\nAbout 4 years ago similar feelings happening inside me before getting on stage in front of a live audience of about 100 people and someone asked me if I was excited to share. I started crying and said “I’m so nervous”. I’ll always remember what happened next.

mlm,"""Here’s the real real about entrepreneurship.\n\nIt is hard. It is extraordinary, meaning you have to step out of ordinary. Ordinary thinking. Ordinary action. Ordinary work ethic. It requires winning in the dark. Facing rejection. Sweat equity. It requires expansion of oneself and of one’s comfort zone. You will ave naysayers. You will (hopefully) be obsessed. People won’t understand you. People will tell you to get back in line. People will ghost you. You may lose friends. Your circle will change. It will be uncomfortable. \n\nBut on the other side of that, is beauty. Is growth. The human soul CRAVES growth. It CRAVES making a difference and having a purpose. It CRAVES freedom. \n\nEntrepreneurship can give you ll those things. But whoever told you it would be easy is lying. \n\nEasy? No. Fulfilling? Absolutely. \n\nIf you’ve had a tug on your heart to explore entrepreneurship, I encourage you to do it. But know it will require your full heart and your full commitment. Not necessarily full commitment of time, but a two feet in, dive in head first approach, otherwise you won’t make it.\n\nUltimately, it can provide a beautiful life for you and your family. But you have to be willing to work for a short amount of time like most people won’t, so you can live a life that most people don’t.\n\nYour favorite corporate dropout turned lifestyle entrepreneur,\nWade\n\n#lifestyleentrepreneur #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship #entrepreneurlife #corporatedropout #9to5dropout"""

mlm,"""It all started with Sandy committing to her health, as a customer, closed off to the business. \n\nBut her experience using the products and doing Arbonne’s transformative 30 days to healthy living program opened her eyes up to how good she could really feel, which opened her eyes up to the possibility of helping others feel that way. \n\nShe has always been a good friend to people and her whole life was seeking an opportunity to build a career around helping people.\n\nThen she met the community, met people who were successful in Arbonne and it opened up her vision to what this could be for our family.\n\nSandy’s transformative journey through Arbonne, reflects a personal evolution from a past self to a healthier, happier, and more fulfilled individual. Initially skeptical about the business aspect, Sandy experienced significant health improvements after two months as a customer, all of which she attributes to better gut health and lifestyle changes promoted by Arbonne’s products. This profound impact on her well-being led to an epiphany: Arbonne provided the perfect avenue to combine her passion for helping others with a viable career opportunity. Sandy’s story is a testament to being open to new experiences and how embracing change can unlock the best version of oneself, turning one into a genuine advocate for the products that catalyzed their transformation. Discover the power of personal growth and the potential of opportunities that align with your values and aspirations.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about what Arbonne could do for you, message one of us “Interested” and we’ll ask some questions to see if we can help you!\n\n#arbonne #lifestyleentrepreneur #happy #healthy #thriving #community #publicspeaker #businesscoaching #mentorship #leadership"""

For me, as someone who lifts heavy and is looking to build/maintain muscle mass - it’s very important I eat a lot of protein. \n\nThe best protein sources are grass fed, pasture raised meats as well as eggs, fish and plant sources like beans, lentils, chickpeas and more. \n\nBut most people probably aren’t getting enough protein, that’s where supplementing with a protein shake comes in. It’s an easy, delicious and bioavailability way to get an extra 20-30g of protein in one shake.\n\nWe love our Arbonne shakes, as they are not only a very CLEAN, bioavailability source of protein, but they contain a complete amino acid profile and also has 24 vitamins and minerals in it, so it’s more than protein.

mlm,"""If I’ve learned anything in my never ending pursuit of my dreams and highest potential, it’s that becoming OBSESSED with your vision, your goals, your dream life, your business, that thing - is absolutely imperative to making it a reality. \n\nObsessed is looked at funny. You’re “weird”. “Abnormal”. But it’s also intriguing, it’s secretly inspiring. When you become obsessed, you will get a lot of pushback, or people talking about you. It has nothing to do with you. You become a mirror for other people, and deep down they see the reflection and their lack of obsession or pursuit towards something. It’s not their fault either. It’s the way of the world. Live and let live. \n\nBut becoming OBSESSED is a way to make your goals inevitable, because it means you won’t stop until the jobs done. And when the job is done, you enjoy the fruits, then find a new mountain to climb.\n\nBe obsessed my friends.

Love doing life and business with you @wellnesswithwade \n\nStory time 👇🏼👇🏼\n\nI started my Arbonne business 5.5 years ago in August of 2018. I was a serial entrepreneur as former brick and mortar franchise owner. I had zero proof I would be successful in this industry but I was intrigued. I used the products for two months and fell in love before I dove into the biz side. At first my goal was to start a side hustle that could make an extra $200/month to help chip away at Wade’s student loan debt. Well this started taking off and my vision started to explode🚀. Within the first 6 months I walked away from my prior career in real estate and Wade partnered with me. Yay my dream! I always told him I dreamed of us doing this business together but he didn’t see it for himself (at first). After attending our global training conference in Vegas and learning more about the business side of things he was all in. We officially partnered in biz and few months later he left his prior career as a VP in finance. He was officially a corporate dropout and by March of 2020 (18 months after launching) we had built to the top 1% of our company.\n\nThe products changed my health but the business changed our life. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽\n\n*our story isn’t typical to learn what is please visit www.earnings.arbonne.com*\n\nWe are so grateful to work together as lifestyle entrepreneurs & career pivot coaches and we can help YOU make the change your soul is craving…\n\nFill out the “apply to work with us” link in my bio to connect further 🪩🎉"""

mlm,"""Your dream life is closer than you think. \n\nHere are 3 ways to bring your dreams into reality:\n\n1️⃣ Get CLEAR on what your dreams are. Go deep on the WHY behind it. Clarity leads to confidence and conviction as well as ACTION. Go deeper than the money. You don’t care about a million dollars, you care about the freedom that can give you. WHAT do you want and WHY do you want it?\n\n2️⃣ ACTION - take action towards your dreams every day. A dream is built brick by brick with small daily steps. Create habits in your life that bring you closer to your dreams with each passing day.\n\n3️⃣ Find your vehicle - oftentimes you can have a dream and you can take action, but you need to also have a vehicle that can take you to your dreams. For example, my dream was to be a present Dad, travel the world with my family, go to the beach on a random Tuesday. I realized being a VP in Finance in the corporate world was not a vehicle to my dream life. So I became an Entrepreneur and my own boss. \n\nI love helping other people create their dream lives.

mlm,"""This industry isn’t rocket science…\n\nIs it easy? No. \n\nIs it simple? Yup! \n\nIs it for everyone? Noooope. \n\nCan it be for anyone? Yes.\n\nIs this multi trillion dollar industry going anywhere?\nNope. (Anyone who is saying that is very out of touch + uneducated/likely trying to sell you their program to “build your own online brand” and fearing you out of partnering with a legit NWM company)\n\nIf you are willing to become a student of network marketing and treat this like an actual BUSINESS (not a hobby) this model can transform your life. \n\nA lot if happening in our industry right now. Ensuring that you partner with a brand that has history is crucial. Who owes the company is also extremely important. DO YOUR RESEARCH. \n\nSelling a product that is CONSUMABLE on a 30 day cycle is also important. Ask yourself how often will my customers be using their products and how often will they need to reorder? If it’s a product that only needs to be replaced every 6 months that’s not the smartest option. Make sure the company isn’t just in one lane (i.e. just skincare, just makeup, just wine, just jewelry etc). \n\nYou must diversify the ways you can help people and be in several multi billion dollar industries. What are the company’s morals? Are they transparent? Does most of their $ come from reps in the field or from ACTUAL customers? Are they making money or bleeding out slowly? What certifications do they have? Are they profit focused or do they focus on people and the planet over profit (a company that is a certified B corp is always extremely smart to align with). Are they focused on personal growth and development or is it more flashy ground floor flash get rich quick energy 😬❌? \n\nPartnering with leaders that are doing the do day in and day out who are always learning, growing and duplicating other leaders is essential to YOUR growth. Do NOT get caught up in the money or who has “the best comp plan” 😂…trust your gut and partner with the brand that feels aligned with you, your believes, your lifestyle, your mindset and can help the most people. \n\nIf you are sharing your finds on prime day…why aren’t you building a NWM biz yet?! \n\nLink in bio to apply to work with us 🚀"""
mlm,"""Hey if you love sharing links to lots of different brands and aren’t worried about money, all the power to you! Keep going!\n\nBut if you want to be compensated for what you’re sharing, compensated for your impact, compensated more than one time when you introduce a customer to a brand, you should consider Network Marketing. Notice I said consider, not join. \n\nLet’s be honest, affiliate marketing is nice, but Network Marketing can create FREEDOm in your life, if you’re willing to work for it. \n\nAffiliate marketing is sharing a product, delivering people in your network to a brand and receiving typically 5-20% on the first time sale. Super smart for the brand, not the best for the affiliate if monetizing your influence is the goal. \n\nWe’re all sharing things we love and use Whether it’s our favorite restaurant, gym, health products, beauty products, movies and beyond. If you have an interest in creating an extra stream of revenue from your recommendations, Network Marketing is the smartest way to do that.\n\nIt allows you to create your own customer base, to which if you are recommending consumable products, you will continue to receive commissions on. In doing so, you build community and you build influence! It’s more than just sharing a link and bouncing from brand to brand. \n\nSome people just want to share things they love and aren’t worried about making any money, and that’s great if you’re financially set. But guess what? How many people in your life aren’t financially set? \n\nYou see Network Marketing allows you to empower other people to build a business and create financial flexibility int heir life, or beyond. It utilizes leverage, a tool used in business to help any business scale their reach and their impact. Income follows impact in this profession. \n\nIt’s also a tremendous vehicle for personal growth and learning entrepreneurship and business, at a very low startup cost. \n\nIf you’re interested to learn more, shoot me a message saying “Interested” and I’d be happy to share more with you. The coolest part? I’m not successful just by recruiting you. My success is dependent on helping YOU be successful, whatever that looks like to you.\n\n#networkmarketing"""

And it’s not that they didn’t work hard, they did so AROUND their life and ultimately to live a life by design. \n\nThe further I investigated, I realized OK it’s not easy to become an entrepreneur. You need an idea and a lot of money then to work tirelessly for years. It’s high risk, high reward.\n\nThen I realized there’s a better way. A simpler way. To become an entrepreneur, part-time, around your life. It’s network marketing. It’s a way you can partner with an established brand, with established product, systems and mentorship and build a distribution system to help clients. \n\nNetwork marketing is an opportunity for people to make grocery money, a few extra hundred dollars a month,or it can be a vehicle that can be a career for you and honestly the sky is the limit financially. \n\nIt’s not easy, but it is simple. It requires work, like anything worthwhile, but it allows you to leverage your time through technology, social media, building and training a team to be successful and beyond. \n\nIt’s the best way I know how to build a life of freedom, if you’re willing to work for it. \n\nThat’s our story. My wife and I partnered with a health & wellness brand with the vision of creating a beautiful life together through this vehicle.

mlm,"""The glow up has been REAL!! Sometimes you have to hit a breaking point and be sooooo sick and tired of your own shit to inspire a lasting change….\n\nIn the pictures before the beat dropps I was 29 years old (these were all taken in 2017). I was exhausted all the time, sluggish, full of inflammation, always anxious, felt like a walking ball of grief/sadness, ate way too much del taco, drank too much alcohol and coffee, had horrible gas & stomach issues every day, looked at life with the glass half empty mindset, struggled with headaches all the time and often had eczema outbreaks and rashes. The list could go on and on but the truth is I was unhappy, unfulfilled in life, very insecure and felt like shit the majority of the time. \n\nIn 2018 I was introduced to Arbonne and life has never been the same 💚 I’m now 35 and the happiest and healthiest I’ve ever been!! I am eternally grateful that the last 6 year have been filled with personal growth, breakthrough, learning to love myself, growing a family (got married and have two healthy beautiful baby girls) and built my confidence + self esteem all while building a multi million dollar e-commerce business centered around health and wellness! \n\nI love what I do as a consultant with Arbonne and feel like I’m walking in my purpose helping people the way I get to everyday!

mlm,"""Why network marketing > over being an “influencer”! If you are someone who has built a following of any size where people look to you and you INFLUENCE them on the daily you would be straight up not business savvy (sorry to call you out but it’s true) to not lock arms with a network marketing company! You are SLEEPING on the opportunity of a lifetime…If you do brand deals, LTK, Amazon influencer and affiliates links whyyyy aren’t you doing network marketing?! It’s time to stop playing small and partner with a brand you align with ⬇️\n\nI highly recommend partnering with a brand that has: \n\n•history (I personally would stay far away from a “ground floor opportunity” not trying to be a guinea pig) and high standards/clean ingredients/certifications that you’d feel authentic promoting \n\n•products in several multi billion dollar industries (not a brand that JUST sells in one arena like skincare or makeup or nutrition) partner with a brand that has something to serve your clients in every area of their life every single day multiple times a day!\n\n•consumable products (specifically on a 30 day supply) not something your customers only need to replace 2-3 times a year\n\n•a company that values personal growth and has amazing leadership, resources and tools\n\n•a company that offers perks outside of just weekly commission and overrides (like car bonuses, incentive trips and global training conferences you can attend) if the company doesn’t do these things and isn’t investing in your growth and rewarding you for it I would stay away\n\nWe dropped an episode on this topic on July 16th on our podcast Getting Magnetic with Sandy + Wade @gettingmagnetic !

mlm,"""5 lessons I learned from being with top ~.1% leaders in our Company the past week in Iceland:\n\n1️⃣ Every single person here at some point made a DECISION they wanted a bigger life, they were done with their old life and this was a vehicle that could get them from where they were to where they wanted to go. Everyone had a VISION for a better life, and was willing to work for it.\n\n2️⃣ Coachable. Everyone was willing to be coachable, to follow the steps, to be new, to suck at first, to learn, to grow, to not let a few no’s or rejection stop them from where they were going. Coachability is one of the biggest indicators to success in this industry. An insatiable appetite for learning and growth is a great indicator.\n\n3️⃣ Obsession. Everyone at one point, or multiple points in their business had an OBSESSION to reach the top. Obsession gets a bad rep sometimes because it is intense and makes normal people feel uncomfortable, but I believe it is a pre-requisite to success. There will be obsession seasons.\n\n4️⃣ Everyone had different backgrounds. You realize there is no particular personality trait, background, skills, age, or anything else that causes someone to be successful in this business. It’s not what you’re equipped with, it’s how you use what you’re equipped with and what you’re willing to do that makes the difference.\n\n5️⃣ Mission. Every one in Iceland is on a MISSION, and it’s bigger than money. Money can be a part of the mission, but everyone wants to build something MASSIVE, make a huge impact, be the best, something bigger than them that is driving them.\n\nThose are just a few lessons from an incredible week with even more incredible people. Moral of the story, if you want something bad enough, you will do what it takes, to become the person, who earns that life. Most of the time it’s not a lack of vision for what you want, it’s that you tried to bargain for the price. \n\nGrateful for this trip to Iceland and LASER FOCUSED on earning the 2025 Bali trip by helping people take their life, their finances, their health, their impact to the next level through this vehicle. \n\nIf you’re intrigued, send us a message and we’ll open up the conversation."""

We like to say social media is the documentary of our life, but our goal is to connect with people in person.\n\nOur business, which is much more than social media, has afforded us a life of lifestyle freedom, abundance, the ability to invest and travel the world freely, and we’re just getting started.\n\nWe’re looking to partner with 3 motivated individuals to help you create another source of income, online and offline.\n\nIf you’re interested, there’s an apply to work with us link in our bio.\n\n#socialmedia #contentcreators #powercouples #moneymoves #travel #travelcouple #lifestyleentrepreneur \n\nHave an epic day!"""

mlm,"""I’m not going to even go into the business side of it. You can ask us privately for that info.\n\nWhat we will go into is the insane amount of growth in our life that all started with a decision to partner with Arbonne, a health & wellness brand, for $99 registration fee + products we were interested in - all backed by a 90 day satisfaction guarantee and no further commitments or costs from there. \n\nThe growth started with our health. We found a simple, highly effective program to follow to understand what fueled our body and what didn’t, supported by incredible products. That is our flagship 30 Days Program. \n\nThat 30 days turned into a lifestyle. Healthy habits compound and we found ourself feeling better than ever and on fire for life. It’s amazing what one domino can do.\n\nThe health domino led us to the business side of Arbonne. It’s pretty easy to share and sell something you genuinely use and love.\n\nWe realized the business side had tremendous financial opportunity, but what we didn’t realize was the personal growth that would be attached to it. \n\nArbonne is a health & wellness business, but it can become a personal & professional growth business. You commit to learning, growing, taking action, setting goals, being coachable and you become a new version of yourself, an elevated version. \n\nIf you asked us if we’d rather have the business growth in the last 6 years, or who we’ve become as people, as leaders, as parents, and we could have one or the other - we’d choose the personal growth 10/10 times.\n\nFurther, beyond the growth, the community and network we’ve gained is something we didn’t even know we were seeking, but value SO much. A community of go getters, of heart led people, with a motto of “rising tides lift all boats”.\n\nLastly, the impact you make by becoming the best version of you and becoming a leader, is priceless.\n\nSo yes, there is an opportunity for better health Arbonne. But what it really is is growth of your soul. It’s passion. It’s purpose. Its impact. It’s community. \n\nIf you feel a tug on your heart to explore the opportunity, we encourage you to do just that, explore it.\n\nSend us a message and we’ll go from there.\n\nEarnings.arbonne.com"""

She’s the type of woman that sets goals and goes for them. She’s one of the most kind, caring and generous people I’ve ever met.

mlm,"""When you find your life partner, you choose to build a life together. \n\nThe first step is to align on the vision you guys have for your life together.

Decide what you want that legacy to be together and how you’ll impact the world. \n\nThe next level, a true force multiplier on your life, is when not only do you align on a vision together, you align in a vehicle that can get you to that vision, to that life. \n\nMy wife @sandycritides and I always had dreams for our life together…but those dreams started to come to life when we aligned together on a vehicle that could get us there. \n\nWe now help couples start an e-commerce opportunity together alongside what they’re already doing to help you build your dream life together.

mlm,"""Weekend recap! What a weekend. There’s something about investing in yourself that hits different. Attending something that you know is going to grow you. Not only mentally in the ability to gain inspiration and tools to build your business, but to build your soul, your spirit, your community and your vision. \n\nThat was this leadership retreat in Dallas for us. Our vision is bigger than ever for our team, for our business, for our future, but more so for YOU! \n\nThe first picture is how much we raised in one hour through auctioning off things like retreats at leaders houses (including 2 at our house!), fun gifts, products, etc. It was amazing to see 150 people come together and make a difference like that. That $214k is going straight to feed Haitian children who are in a hunger and overall crisis as their entire country is being overtaken by gangs currently. We will send 2.1 million meals into Haiti to help feed these children and give them hope for a better future through the foundation Mission of Hope’s work.\n\nIt’s pretty special to see a company, a team, a community, who on the outside looks like they sell fizz and protein and greens and make money, come together and be so much more than that. You truly don’t know the culture, the spirit, the heart of Arbonne and what the opportunity is truly about until you’re in it.\n\nOne of our biggest takeaways from this weekend is that we all are responsible for building a BIG platform, because when you do the ripple effect of good done in the world is so much greater. \n\nSee the pinned comment for a powerful story on just that.\n\nSandy and I are more inspired than ever to grow. To grow our impact. We will always lead from the front and do the do. We want to invite you to come with us. If you’ve been watching on the sidelines, we want you to get an inside look at what Arbonne can do for you.

They give us multiple opportunities every year to earn incentive trips. This year we’ve been to Maui, Iceland and Costa Rica. \n\nWhat may be even cooler than the locations, is the community that comes with it. Arbonne is a community with core values around health & wellness, growth, kindness, camaraderie and making an impact on others. \n\nI love that our kids get to grow up in an environment like that. Not only with us, but with the greater community of Arbonne. \n\nOn this trip we saw monkeys, played in the pool and on the beach every day, hung with friends, ate well at the all inclusive restaurants, caught epic sunsets, fire shows and beyond. \n\nOur hearts are full, our cheeks are a bit sunburned and we are focused on continuing to lead from the front and help other people live a life they desire while traveling the world and making a difference with and for our family. \n\nWe hope you’ll join us soon! \n\n#costarica #travelvlog #puravida #costaricatravelvlog #familytravel #arbonne #incentivetrip"""

mlm,"""Coming off one of the best weekends of our lives, I think this is the most aligned we’ve ever felt in life. Everything is flowing. That doesn’t mean everything is perfect, but everything is happening for us.\n\nLast week 18 leaders on our Arbonne team flew into Colorado to attend the Elevate Retreat at our house. \n\nThe intention we set for the retreat was to ELEVATE. Elevate our personal growth, elevate our knowledge of ourselves, elevate our connections and bonding on our team, elevate our vision bigger and including helping more people, elevate our impact, elevate our FUN, elevate our vibration to go out in the world and make a positive ripple.\n\nWe did just that and more. We cried, we danced, we laughed, we bonded, we did epic content, we adventured, we got poured into, we practiced all the best wellness habits and we came together to create one of the most special 3 days of our lives.\n\nIt’s amazing what people can do when they came together around a shared vision. Our vision has never been bigger or clearer for how we’re going to use the Arbonne vehicle to change people’s lives and ultimately change the world as big as we can.\n\nWe’re in a health crisis. People need guidance and access to creating healthier habits. To create more energy. Create more production but also more life. People are struggling financially, people need more financial peace in their life. But beyond those things, people need community, need to feel like they belong to something bigger, people need a mission, a vision and a way to impact people around them.\n\nThat’s really what we do in Arbonne. We impact people to live better, live bigger, make an impact. As a result, financial prosperity can be generated.\n\nIf you’ve been watching from the sidelines, it’s time to take a look and see if what Arbonne has to offer and your unique skills, gifts and network is a good match.\n\nYou’ll never know until you know, send us a private message with questions, hesitations or if you’re ready to take action and get started."""

Hannah was about 6 years old at the time.  It was the middle of the night and when we looked out the window we could see the lights of small towns and villages below us.  Hannah asked me, \""Are those lights the stars that we see at night?\"" \n\nEvery time I think about that moment I am still awestruck at the uncensored imaginations we have as children!  Space and time are limitless.  There was a time in our life when we believed that anything is possible.

mlm,"""Pitching for Progress: Entrepreneurs on the Mound 🧢🚀\n\nWhat's up, team! Let's throw a curveball into our usual chat and talk pitchers – not the kind on the mound, but the entrepreneurial kind. You see, in the game of business, being a pitcher means you're always ready to throw your next big idea. 🤔⚾\n\nJust like those baseball pros, entrepreneurs gotta have a killer arm – I'm talking about skills, resilience, and the ability to adapt. Every pitch you throw is a chance to strike out doubt and hit a win. But here's the thing, getting too comfy on the pitcher's mound? That's a no-go. 🙅‍♀️🛑\n\nYou might have the best startup slider in the league, but if you're not constantly working on your pitch, the business game will pass you by. So, what do you do? You keep training, keep learning, and keep aiming for that perfect game. 🏋️‍♀️📚\n\nDon't let success be your signal to slow down. Instead, let it fuel you to pitch even better, faster, and smarter. Remember, every day is game day, and you're the ace on the mound. Let's show 'em what we've got and keep pushing for that no-hitter! 🔥🎯"""

I was just in the motions. I was also watching someone else get better, glow up. \n\nI was still binge eating, struggling, crying, feeling so stressed that I had high blood pressure, giving me migraines, I was down in deep depression but still had to be a mom and show up. \n\nI finally started the happy juice with the intention of making an income from it but in reality what I got from it was soooooo much more. Yes I wanted the 5 orders to make $500 but guess what I wanted. No. What I needed more was the mental health!\n\nI finally was able to focus,  not feel so on the edge or overwhelmed constantly. I could remember things which was such huge break thru for me because I kept forgetting things due to the high stress 😩. I finally was feeling better mentally. I wasn't soo moody.  So defensive.

I was struggling getting the views I wanted on reels and boom 💥 my friend came in and shared an amazinh training with me. \n\nI feel so confident now that I will knock out my upcoming content and the people I really want to reach will actually see my stuff. That is life changing. You social media audience is everything when it comes to followers and exposure online.

I've been the mom saving gift cards to pay off the trip or paying it all in one shot. I've been the mom hoping we don't spend too much or go way overboard while on the trip. I've also been the mom who couldn't simply afford to go on any trip during the summer because it was just not in my budget. \n\nIf you are feeling this post, I want you to know that we do have a solution for you to earn an extra $500 a month by 5 enrollments, totally up to you how fast you earn it too!!

I was always rushed by the school because I was late for pick up due to my employers not caring that I had to go get my kids because their job was more important to them. I randomly got a message about a work from home job and I watched for a long long while before I finally said screw it let me do it! \n\nThat was all the way back in 2019, can you believe that yes brought me here to where I am today. I didn't really think anyone could make money from their social media and I hated sales so I was like yeah sure we will see but wow I've learned an grown so much from that one yes. Of course it's been hard and I've seen up n downs, bad times and even more that was shit. \n\nI kept pushing forward. I didn't give up on me.

I decided I'd drink my happy juice around 11:30am and it didn't work miracles but it helped me start. \n\nWhen I started, I got the dishes washes, the dish washer loaded, lunch cooked for my son and I, cleaned the counters, started the dryer again. I guess the happy juice got me going so I could make progress today. Not everyday is an easy day or a great day but we can choose to do something to make us feel better and get us started in the right direction. That's what I did by drinking my happy juice and honestly, I'll probably drink a second one before the kids get home from school and the evening madness kicks in. \n\nIt's been a bit rough couple of days, Frank has been working a little later, the kids sports are starting to kick in and it's just been a little stressful but here are. The weekend is finally here and we can hopefully catch up and catch a break. If you haven't started Happy Juice, just start. Stop being miserable all the time and wallowing in it because it won't change until you do something to change it. It won't be a miracle worker but it will START Working on your mental health and that is when the good starts happening in your life. \n\np.s. right now I have a $10 off coupon and I can waive your brand partnership fee so you can start sharing your own results and make money too! Work on yourself while you're making a side hustle income. Seems like a win - win to me!"""

mlm,"""Cortisol is your body’s built in alarm system & main stress hormone.\n\nComment CORTISOL & follow for more tips on parenting & regulating it!\n\nI’m Nicolette, family paralegal turned SAHM & here are a few signs that you could be having issues regulating stress in your body. \n\n• Mood swings: If your body is under a lot of stress & the ‘alarm button’ stays on (continuously exposed to stress & producing cortisol) it can lead to increased anxiousness & depressed feelings. If you’ve felt constantly irritated, stressed, and you are having intense mood swings, your cortisol could be dysregulated. Cortisol has also been found to be a biomarker for many mental health illnesses.\n\n• Overeating & Weight issues: Under stress, you are more likely to order a milkshake & fries versus a balanced meal because cortisol regulates blood sugar & impacts your satiety. The chemical messengers that tell your body to stop eating are completely thrown off. When the chemical messengers that tell us to stop eating are thrown off and we are too stressed to make healthy choices, the results often wreak havoc on our metabolic habits. \n \n• Overstimulation and parenting problems: Because cortisol triggers the fight/flight response- when this is ON- you’re way more likely to scream, feel irritated quickly, have low tolerance to noise and overall DREAD going out with your kids. When this alarm is OFF (regulated) you are much more likely to parent CALMER!\n\nIf you have experienced any of these issues& feel like you e tried EVERYTHING- I guarantee you haven’t tried this yet. You MIGHT want to consider some holistic habits to regulate this particular stress hormone. \n\nOnce I began incorporating a cortisol regulating mocktail into my routine, I saw INCREDIBLE results! \nLess anxiety/depression\nMore enjoyment w/my kids\nLess stress\nImproved digestion\nProlonged mood benefits\nLittle to no hormonal issues \n\nDrop CORTISOL and follow @happyjuice_mom and I’ll send information on the holistic drink I use to regulate these issues!"""

It feels great to start the new week with a fresh, organized space!\n\n🎉 I’m also grateful for my “happy juice” that helps me stay laser-focused and work intentionally throughout the day. It regulates my hormones so I’m not mom-raging, moody, or easily upset. No overstimulation, no stress, and I feel great without high blood pressure or indigestion. My mind is at ease and happier, allowing me to be productive and not stuck in bed or on the couch. \n\nHere’s to balancing fun and productivity as we jump into another week!

mlm,"""Being a mom can be very stressful, chaotic, busy, overwhelming, loud, overstimulated, and so much more, but it can also be happy, fun, funny, good-busy! \n\nWhen I started drinking happy juice 🥤, I wasn't the good mom. I was the obligated, okay I'll do, survival mom. I wanted to be the patient, loving, fun, balanced mom. Happy juice gave me that! I stopped being so overstimulated and overwhelmed all the time. I also stop screaming and running away from my kids with all the chaos they brought with them after school. I didn't have to silence anymore, I was okay with how they were because I realized it was just me freaking out cause of how badly I feeling. \n\nI'm so happy I started even though I was skeptical. I did watch someone else share her story and the way she changed for the better was amazing to see that she could find herself again and I wanted that so badly. \n\nFast forward months later and I don't know what I'd do without happy you ❤️. \n\nComment HAPPY for info. \nFollow me 👉 \n\n90 day money back guranteed so nothing to risk at all!"""

It's something that most people can't believe they didn't start earlier once they try it. My personal results speak for themselves. I'm a different person when I drink my happy juice 😌. I'm more patient, I'm not stressed or overstimulated, I'm not mom raging, I'm not snappy, I'm not inflamed, I'm not dysfunctional or paralyzed with a massive migraine because my blood pressure is thru the roof. I can focus and get so much done.

Stop saying this isn't something you need but your whole life is upside down because your mental sanity is off the charts. Stop saying you can't afford it but if a doctor prescribed you pills and your insurance didn't cover it, you'd figure it out. Stop saying it doesn't work when nothing you've tried has but you tried it and this has a 90 day money back guranteed. \n\nDid you know 50% of mothers with mental health issues are not diagnosed and 75% of them are not treated?

mlm,"""Why I won’t go a day without my happy juice…\n\nSomeone recently said to me they were going to wait to buy happy juice as a ‘reward’ for hitting some goals. \n\nI thought to myself…\n\n“This is not a luxury product. This is a necessity.”\n\nThis isn’t just another supplement that is trending right now. \n\nIn today’s society with the depletion of soil and lack of good quality food, we NEED to prioritize our health with supplements. \n\nBut not with any old supplements. \n\nI used to take supplements because that’s what everyone was doing. \n\nI didn’t feel any different but just assumed they were doing something good for my body. \n\nI didn’t realize you could feel SO DIFFERENT on a supplement. \n\nAre you currently taking supplements because you think you should but you don’t actually feel any different? \n\nIf that’s the case you are wasting your money. \n\nWhat I love about happy juice is it’s actually delicious which makes it so easy to take every day (pills I often forget because I don’t ’look forward’ to taking them). \n\nAnd because of the way it makes me feel and how it’s changed the way our family operates, I WILL NEVER GO A DAY WITHOUT IT. \n\nAnd with Valentina now consistently on Kids Happy Juice + Kids Mood I have seen a NOTICEABLE difference in his behavior. \n\nShe is so much more amicable, helpful, happy and CREATIVE. \n\nShe is doing so well at school.\n\nSo I encourage you to try these supplements for your family. \n\nIf cost is an issue I encourage you to redirect your spending. \n\nThe target runs (you know what I’m talking about), excessive coffee consumption (I love a Starbucks run like anyone else but if you’re doing it daily that’s a lot of money and happy juice will stop you from wanting caffeine so much), eating out/takeaway (again these are a wonderful treat but do you need to be doing it as often as you are?).\n\nI definitely don’t want to take away the little joys in your life but if you want to feel good on a daily basis then it’s worth considering cutting down costs in other places. \n\nHappy Juice is worth it for the profound effect it has. \n\nIf you’d like to learn more about it we have some health care professionals running a 6 week mini series on the science behind it!"""

As a mom, you might be juggling a thousand things and still feel like you’re falling short, trying to give your family the Christmas they deserve, but feeling the weight of not having enough to make it all happen.\n\nI get it. I’ve been there. But here's a little reminder from me and Frank: There are ways to make extra income, that fit into your schedule and offer freedom, even when things feel overwhelming. This morning, we braved the freezing cold to grab some Dunkin’ Donuts to celebrate how awesome it feels to have the 𝓽𝓲𝓶𝓮 𝓯𝓻𝓮𝓮𝓭𝓸𝓶  to do things like that – all while still earning an income. It's not about being lucky or knowing the \""𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭\"" people. It's about developing skills that allow you to work from anywhere and create your own opportunities.\n\nIf you're skeptical about taking the leap into something new – that’s completely okay! We all start at the beginning, and it’s not about who you know, but what skills you’re willing to learn and apply. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the holidays and could use some extra income, know that there’s a way for you to carve out time and earn money that works with your life.\n\nLet’s make this Christmas a little brighter without the added financial stress. You’re capable of more than you think, and I’m here to help guide you through it! 💪🎅\n\n#MomsSupportingMoms #ExtraIncome #HolidayHustle #TimeFreedom #YouGotThis #SkillsNotConnections #ChristmasStress #OverwhelmToEmpowerment"""

Hundreds of thousands of neurotransmitters are constantly emitting millions of internal messages and signals between your gut and brain. Conversely, your brain and gut are also continually exposed to chemicals, pathogens and oxidative stress that can impact how effectively you process these internal messages. These external influencers can add a tremendous load to your gut-brain communication pathways and cause it to become sluggish.\n\nOccasionally. it is essential to \""reboot\"" our body particularly our gut and endocrine organs - in order to improve the formation of neurotransmitters and the communication along the gut-brain axis. \n\nAmare's Reboot+ is the first and only 3-day \""scientific reboot\"" program designed to reset your gut-brain axis, It sets a healthy, clean foundation for your microbiome so you can obtain optimal results with the world's first award-winning gut-brain axis nutrition system the Amare FundaMentals Pack. \n\nReboot+ is formulated with patented and plant-based ingredients to support the natural cleansing and filtering of your colon, kidneys and liver.

I was a mom of 2 working a 8 to 6pm as a paralegal for almost 8years and it sucked when I had to call out or request time to take my kid to the doctor. Not to mention I always missed any activities in school or afterschool because my hours wouldn't let me be present and God forbid I asked to go attend a class party or sport game. I hated it!

mlm,"""This year, as I wrap my kids' Christmas presents, I can't help but reflect on how far we've come. I remember a few years ago when Christmas was a struggle. We barely had enough to make ends meet, let alone buy gifts for my kids. It was heartbreaking to see their excitement, knowing I couldn’t give them what they truly deserved. That Christmas was a turning point for me.\n\nI made a promise to myself that I would never let that happen again. I took action, invested in myself, and found ways to change our financial situation. And now, here we are—able to afford not only presents, but also the joy of knowing that my kids will wake up to a tree full of gifts that will make them smile.\n\nSure, today started a little late with the kids getting off to school a bit behind, but I am beyond grateful for where we are. The fact that we can afford these gifts, the fact that I am able to provide for my family in a way I couldn’t before—that's the real gift.\n\nThis isn’t about bragging, it's about showing you that if I can do it, so can you. If you're stuck in a situation that feels like it will never change, know that you have the power to make a difference. It might take time, but it starts with taking action.\n\nThe reason I’m sharing this is to inspire you to think differently. To see beyond your current circumstances and realize that there’s always an opportunity to change. Just like I took action to change our financial story, you can too.\n\nIf you're ready to start your own journey toward a better life, I’d love to talk about a business opportunity that could help you create the financial freedom you deserve.\n\nLet’s make next Christmas the start of something new for you. Take action today, and let’s make it happen! 💪🎁 #ChristmasInspiration #FinancialFreedom #TakeAction"""

Last year I even had a reel blow up with nasty comments because women felt the need to bash the fact that I got my kids many presents. I never asked for their opinion, I was just sharing a reel about my kids opening presents. \n\nTo rewind this episode of my life, there was a time where I couldn't afford a good Christmas for my kids. I couldn't take my kids on vacation, none the less spoil them with presents. I took that personally and made it a mission to make sure that never happened again. I don't mean you have to spend hundreds of dollars on your kids for a great Christmas but that is totally upto how you see fit for you and yours BUT I am a bit extra. \n\nNow, that we are at opening day of Christmas, we have to start planning for the New Year 2025, thinking about what we want or need. Asking each other about drawing up our dream board and creating goals together. If you're reading this wishing, hoping, hating, or rolling your eyes because you can't afford it, your brain is telling you that it could never happen for you. I'm here to tell you that YOU CAN, YES YOU! \n\nIf I had an amazing opportunity for you to make an extra $1,000 by end of January if not MORE, by sharing something that could help so many others and YOUR or YOUR KIDS mental health, why wouldn't you?

mlm,"""\""Where dreams become reality\""\n\nWith customer success being Atomy's first management objective, Atomy hosts various seminars online and offline to support and ensure the success of those who choose to pursue the Atomy business. \n\nWhen you first think of network marketing, you typically think of needing to sell some sort of products to others, right? However, Atomy’s approach is different. With Atomy, you don’t have to worry about convincing people to buy products they don’t need. Instead, your focus is on sharing the benefits of Atomy’s products and the unique system behind them. By helping others understand how Atomy can enhance their daily lives and turn their expenses into income, you can effortlessly build a successful business.\n\nAtomy provides any and ALL training materials you could ever think of and need, and you are 110% supported by your sponsor and every sponsor above them (at least on OUR team you are! We have the best! 💕). Even national in-person seminars are free and available to EVERYONE -zero need to \""qualify\"" to attend. \n\nI admit, I was skeptical at first because of past experiences with network marketing, but after speaking with our family member (and Sponsor) Scott who has been with Atomy for only 4 years, and seeing the achievements that are possible, first hand I was SOLD!  Atomy REALLY DOES make any and all levels of success completely obtainable! Many, MANY partners globally are making 2k,5k, 10k and even 20k a month!  And just think, Atomy is a relatively new company and is only now starting to become known in the US --- 🔥 Things are going to heat up! 🤩 \n\n⭐ What would you do with an extra $60, $360 or $1,200 a DAY?!\n⭐ Can you imagine earning a residual 10k, 20k or even 100k a MONTH?!\n⭐ Do you have a dream bucket list of things you wish to achieve?\n\nLet us help you achieve all of the above! \n\n❗ Remember- this opportunity is available to everyone, but NOT required.  Anyone can be a member of Atomy and buy and use the products. No pressure to do the business side, but it's always available if you were to change your mind.\n\n#atomy #highqualityproducts #atomyusa #atomyamerica #everyone #everydaylife #residualincome  #business"""

mlm,"""🥰I’m going to be real with you all for a second. This is a long one!\n\n🙈This last week has been one of the hardest weeks of my life.\n\n😇But coming out of three emergency room visits for our sweet baby, I am sitting in a place of complete gratitude. I knew the second I had this baby that something was changing within me...a bigger WHY than I had ever felt for my business.\n\n💖Years ago I became a counselor to serve, 𝔽𝕦𝕗𝕚𝕝𝕝 𝕞𝕪 𝕔𝕒𝕝𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕘 from God to help people overcome their emotional and mental blocks to reach their potential. BUT being a counselor I quickly learned three things:\n\n1. Counseling, for many people, was a luxury. I didn’t want to serve only people who could afford 100$/hour for a session. There were SO many people that needed help who literally couldn’t afford it.\n2. There was a key ingredient to this recipe that was missing. I was working with only ½ deck of cards...Here is the thing\n-You can have ALL of the tools that a therapist or counselor can give you in your box but if the serotonin in your brain is off IT. DOESN’T MATTER!😜\n-Guess what- your GUT creates about 95% of the serotonin in your BRAIN!!\n\n💞You guys... 𝗜 𝗵𝗮𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗶𝘁!\nThe missing tool. The reason why people who had tried everything were literally spinning their wheels backwards. I was SO EXCITED! In fact, this gut/brain connection revealed why I was struggling with depression and anxiety as a licensed counselor, especially after having Faith.🙈\n3. needed to be in a position to serve people while also being able to serve this tiny child I had given birth to. My life as a counselor COULD NOT deliver that freedom the way I wanted to.🤸🏼‍♀️💃🏽☀️😇I say all of this to say ᘜOᗪ ᗯOᖇKᔕ Iᑎ ᗰᗴᔕTᗴᖇIOᑌᔕ ᗯᗩYᔕ- Finding plexus allowed me to help people from the inside out, both mentally and physically. It was a business plan that I could feel passionate about - while also being home and serving my family.\nNow...16 years after the first time I heard from GOD, I found an entire new layer..\n⬇️💘The rest in the comments!\n#entrepreneur #lovelife #purpose #godsplannotmine #freedom #guthealth #happymama #counsellor #workfromhomelife #financialfreedom #createyourlife #purposedrivenlife"""

Our Probiotic is a 3 in one product with Probiotics, anti fungals and enzymes!\n\n🌟 Then, BioCleanse steps in to flush out what Probio5 broke up. It is a very gentle daily cleanse so don't let that word \""cleanse\"" scare you! It helps regulate your bowel movements.

I did!\n\n🥰I faced my fears because I knew the science behind why our Reset was so good for you, plus I had gained 5 lbs & some inflammation & bloating on my 3 week trip!\n\n💖Let me tell you, I was shocked that I wasn’t hungry!!!! Being a body builder I usually eat every 2-3 hours of the day & I usually get hangry, so this was such a surprising experience!\n.\n🤷‍♀️Why? Because Reset #TheOrangeBox is working at the cellular level so it’s NOT a quick fix. It’s a nutritionally supported fast that gets your metabolism firing again and using fat as fuel. So it’s not water weight we are losing - it’s fat! And continues long after you finish the box. \n.\n💖For 3 days you eat 68g of protein and 500 calories each day. The health benefits to this type of fasting are far beyond just what you can see in weight loss. It supports cellular renewal, liver support, detox pathways, improves gut health and even helps to eliminate problematic food behaviors through mindful well-being - in other words, it helps my brain to stop thinking I need the snack or the habit of having chocolate in the closet😂\n.\n😜It was shocking to me that all my friends had such great results that lasted long after the Reset! \n\n🎉I was really excited to experience the mental alertness, better sleep, & crazy energy!

That alone speaks volumes of its ever-growing success.🥳\n\nAs once said, “It may have been your grandmother’s cosmetics but it sure isn’t any more!”\nStatistics keep growing with girls and women in their late teens on and through to their 90’s.

mlm,"""I now have a Senior and Sophmore in HS.  I have less than one year before my oldest goes off to college 🥺. My other kid wants to do an exchange program that same year.  They are making me an empty nester ahead of schedule! \n\nAs I look back on our memories back on Kindergarten, first science fairs, club sports, stock shows, academic awards, ceremonies, class parties, all those wonderful and amazing moments I realized how few of them I missed.  I think I can count on one hand the amount of times I had to miss one of my kids events.  And you know what?  Each and every one of them was when I worked outside of the home for someone else.  No joke. \n\nWhen I first became a WFH home with my own network marketing business well over 10 years ago my husband and I knew it was going to take time to build my salary up to what we were used to. We knew that it was not going to be easy.  But we also knew by taking that leap of faith and trusting that God Whisper, we were also about to gain so much more freedom of time with my kids. I served my PTO, had lunches with my kids, chaperoned field trips.  My kids never rode the bus. My kids never went to day care or afterschool care.  I was the one taking them to practices, parties, movies with friends or entertaining kids at our house. \n\nI got to do all those things and my kids remember that.  They might roll their eyes 🙄 now and then, but they remember that I was there for it all. \n\nI had the time and freedom to do it. \nI did not have to ask for permission from my boss. I was my boss. \nI did not get my time docked or made to use my vacation time to go watch a game or tournament.  It was all my time.\n\nI had the opportunity to give my kids the blessing of being there for all their little and big milestones and even though it makes me teary eyed - I am so, so thankful that I made that decision a decade ago to follow my heart and go all in. Thank God for those little whispers and nudges!\n\n The opportunities are out there, momma, I promise they are!  they are waiting for you to just ask about it. \n #spanglishmomboss #mkgirl #myMKlife #pinkcadillac #diamondsandcadillacs #momofteens #GoalGetter2024 #femaleandlatinaownedbusiness"""

mlm,"""not happy with your hair after trying everything !!!! I was in the same boat. \nI get you. \n \nIt’s frustrating. \nMoney and time waisted. \n\nI have the products that will help your scalp and hair. \n\nWhen using the right products, you will see change. \n\nCaring for your scalp is important because it is the foundation for healthy hair. A balanced scalp can help prevent issues like oiliness, dryness, discomfort ranging from temporary irritation and redness to tightness, itchiness, and flakiness, and even premature hair ageing.\n\nBelow are some key factors on how you should look after your scalp. \n\nCleansing: Regularly washing your scalp helps remove dirt, excess oil, and product buildup. It helps prevent clogged hair follicles which can lead to issues like sensitive scalp/scalp discomfort. Use the appropriate sulfate-free MONAT Shampoo for your hair type to avoid stripping your scalp of its natural oils.\n\nConditioning: keeping your scalp hydrated and will help prevent dryness and flakiness. Focus the application of the conditioner and masque on the mid-lengths and ends of the hair to avoid making the scalp too oily.\n\nExfoliation: Scalp exfoliation can remove dead skin cells and product buildup that regular washing might miss. For oily scalp, choose Scalp Purifying Scrub. For dry scalp, choose Scalp Comfort Rebalancing Scalp Treatment. It promotes a healthy scalp environment and can reduce flakiness on the roots, lengths, and ends.\n\nHydration: If your scalp is excessively dry, it can lead to irritation and flakiness.\nUse the appropriate hydrating and moisturising Shampoo, Conditioner, or Masque, along with regular use of Comfort Rebalancing Scalp Treatment and Rebalancing Serum. Include Damage Repair Bond Fortifying Hair Leave-In Cream and REJUVENIQE if your scalp is particularly dry. These products help promote a balanced scalp.\n\nMassage: can stimulate blood flow to the hair follicles, \nIt may promote hair growth."""

mlm,"""I speak from experience. Keratin treatments are often associated with formaldehyde. While they do not actually contain formaldehyde (because formaldehyde\nis a gas), many contain ingredients that release formaldehyde when they are heated or mixed\nwith water. \nExamples include methylene glycol, methanediol, methanal and formalin.\n\nThese chemicals are extremely effective sealers — they are the ingredients that keep your hair smooth and frizz-free. \nHowever, formaldehyde is a known irritant and carcinogen, and a firm NO during pregnancy.\nSo really, to put it bluntly, \nit’s not good for you. \n\nIngredients that really minimise frizzy hair:\n\n⚫️ Black Spruce Bark Extract:\nRich in Vitamin C, Black spruce essential oil is known for its hair-regenerating properties and can promote healthy hair growth.

It also helps to reduce the signs of hair loss and hair thinning.\n\n♥️ Red Algae Extract:\nOmega -3 and omega -6 fatty acids that are known to thicken strands and encourage strong growth. These fatty acids are essential to cell function and improve drastically the density of each strand helping to ward against hair fall, thinning, breakage and split ends allowing hair to thrive and grow.\n\n🤎Desert Date Oil\nIt can be used from head to toe.

mlm,"""“𝓕𝓵𝓪𝔀𝓵𝓮𝓼𝓼 𝓼𝓴𝓲𝓷 𝓼𝓽𝓪𝓻𝓽𝓼 𝔀𝓲𝓽𝓱 𝓪 𝓯𝓵𝓪𝔀𝓵𝓮𝓼𝓼 𝓼𝓴𝓲𝓷𝓬𝓪𝓻𝓮 𝓻𝓸𝓾𝓽𝓲𝓷𝓮!”🧖🏻‍♀️🧖🏻‍♂️✨\n\nWhy is it so important to follow a good skincare routine? I’ll tell you why..\n\nWhen we’re younger, we may not realise that our skin is “aging”. We would go out into the sun ☀️ and wear a low factor or no SPF at all to get that “perfect” tan. But as we get older, the damage we are doing to our skin becomes way more visible. It is not just a vanity thing, not looking after your skin can eventually turn into skin problems like deep wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, acne scars and  even something worse like skin cancer. When left untreated, it’ll just get worse and then you would have to spend more money 💰trying to fix it or going to dermatologists and plastic surgeons.👩🏻‍⚕️🧑🏼‍⚕️ That’s why I believe in preventative solutions. \n\nA lot of people will say that they rather go to a drugstore to buy products, rather than invest in a good skincare range that has been tested by over 20 scientists.👩🏻‍🔬👨🏼‍🔬 And I always say, why spend the bare minimum on something you’ll have the rest of your life. Once your skin is damaged, it’s very hard to fix. So why not spend the extra money 💵 on good quality products?! \n\n@nuskin has become my (skin) life saviour. It’s made my skin look it’s absolute best! With over 20 scientists perfecting the formula every year, I know that I am using the best! Nuskin was named the worlds number 1 brand for anti aging devices 4 years in a row..if that isn’t a reason to use the products/join the company..I don’t know what is. And it also goes beyond skincare..we have access to over 250 products ranging in haircare, beauty, men’s and wellness products. 💇🏻‍♀️💅🧖🏻‍♀️💄\n\nLook after your skin now..with @nuskin your skin will thank you one day!!✨👍🔝\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#skincare #beauty #multibilliondollarbrand #investinyourskin #lookafteryourskin #antiaging #spf #alphahydroxyacids #retinol  #retina #hyaluronicacid #collagen #ageloc #vsco #freepresets #streetetiquette #nuskin #bossbabe #southafricacapetown #followforfollowback #likeforlikes #picoftheday #instaskincare #instagood @amzdavis1989 @belleskinandbeautyct @nuskin @vsco"""

mlm,"""𝙄𝙩’𝙨 𝙣𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙩𝙤𝙤 𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙖𝙜𝙖𝙞𝙣‼️\n\nFailing is something most of us are afraid of, especially as we try to achieve our goals. But the good thing about it is we can always try again.\n\nSecond chances are always available for people reaching their goals and even for budding entrepreneurs. It’s all about how we will use those second chances. And when you think it’s already too late, think again. Like the quote above said, “𝙄𝙩’𝙨 𝙣𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙩𝙤𝙤 𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙖𝙜𝙖𝙞𝙣.” We might never get the same chance we had, but we can always create new opportunities and open ourselves to new chances.\n\n𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐚𝐥𝐥, 𝐝𝐨𝐧’𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐮𝐩 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐢𝐱 𝐢𝐭. It’s all about being persistent in reaching our goal. Failing gives us lessons to learn and gives us room to grow. We become better as we make mistakes and we learn to correct them. Most importantly, we become stronger as we strive to succeed. \n\nStarting again is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, you must be proud of it, for it only shows how determined you are to succeed and how you won’t let failures or challenges stop you from getting to where you want to be.\n\nIf things don’t go your way or things get worst, don’t forget that you can start over again.

mlm,"""Introducing the first beauty who I sponsored into the business 2 years ago… @clareallxone2one 🫶🏻… Clare first approached me about the diet to make some extra money whilst on maternity leave… and the rest is history…We’ve been work besties ever since 👩🏼‍❤️‍👩🏽\nIn her own words 🫶🏻… \n“I became a One2One Diet Consultant whilst on maternity leave, for a bit of extra income when my maternity pay ran out. I never dreamed that my business would take off in the way that it did. I have gone from living paycheck to paycheck, needing to save for months (often years) to make big purchases or go on holidays, to having thousands built up in savings, I bought myself a new family car outright with no finance or loans, and I get to go on holidays and treat my family to gifts and days out whenever I like. This job has legit CHANGED MY LIFE!! Within 6 months of becoming a consultant, I achieved the highest level incentive, which meant that I bagged myself a night away at an Exclusive, All Inclusive, All expenses paid, night away at a top UK hotel, with other consultants across the country who had achieved the same level. I have also won over £1k in shopping vouchers since joining the business almost 18 months ago. Honestly, becoming a One2one Consultant was the best thing that I could have done, not only for me, but for my family, and I will forever be grateful for Jade for giving me this opportunity, and helping me along the way. I now have my own team of consultants that I help to build their own successful businesses. Jade is very supportive of all team, whether that be her first, second, third, or even fourth generation.

mlm,"""I use Camu Camu every day to boost my immunity and more. I don’t wait to get a cold. I hate a cold don’t you? Your kids hate them even worse. \n\nHere are five reasons why you should choose Oliveda’s Camu Camu every day  over elderberry syrup for both yourself and your children:\n\n1. Higher Vitamin C Content: Camu Camu berries are one of the richest sources of natural vitamin C, containing significantly more than elderberries. Vitamin C is essential for immune support, collagen production, and skin health, making Camu Camu a more potent immune-boosting option.\n\n2. Powerful Antioxidant Combo: Camu Camu from Oliveda not only provides vitamin C but also delivers polyphenols like hydroxytyrosol, an incredible powerful antioxidant. These help fight free radicals, protect cells from damage, and may offer broader protection compared to elderberry alone.\n\n3. Enhanced Skin Health: Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, which contributes to youthful and healthy skin. While elderberries provide some skin benefits, Camu Camu’s higher vitamin C levels make it particularly beneficial for skin repair and rejuvenation for both adults and growing children.\n\n4. Supports Energy Levels: Camu Camu’s high vitamin C content aids in iron absorption, which can help prevent anemia and support healthy energy levels. This is particularly important for children, whose growing bodies need sustained energy, and adults who need vitality throughout the day.\n\n5. Gentler on the Digestive System: Elderberry syrup, while helpful for some, can sometimes cause digestive upset in sensitive individuals, especially when consumed in large amounts. Camu Camu is known to be gentler on the stomach, making it more suitable for everyday use, even for younger children.\n\n🫒Hydroxytyrosol Benefits🫒\n1. Antiviral \n2. Antimicrobial \n3. Antioxidant \n4. Anti-inflammatory \n5. Neuroprotective \n6. Cardioprotective \n7. Anticancer \n8. Skin-rejuvenating \n9. Immune-boosting \n10.

And when water is present, preservatives are a must, which often triggers skin inflammation. It’s no surprise that so many people I speak with describe their skin as sensitive.

mlm,"""Around the age of 30, our bodies naturally begin to decrease the production of hyaluronic acid, which can lead to visible signs of aging and other health issues. Here are five top reasons why ingesting hyaluronic acid is beneficial for the body:\n\n\t1.\tImproves Skin Hydration and Elasticity: Hyaluronic acid helps retain moisture in the skin, giving it a more plump, hydrated appearance. Ingesting it can enhance overall skin elasticity, reducing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.\n\t2.\tSupports Joint Health: Hyaluronic acid is a key component of synovial fluid, which lubricates and cushions joints. Regular intake can help reduce joint pain and stiffness, particularly in people with conditions like osteoarthritis.\n\t3.\tBoosts Wound Healing: It aids in tissue regeneration and wound healing by promoting the formation of new blood vessels and controlling inflammation. This can help with faster recovery from skin injuries.\n\t4.\tEnhances Bone Strength: Some studies suggest that hyaluronic acid helps stimulate bone formation and maintain bone density, making it a potential aid in preventing bone-related issues like osteoporosis.\n\t5.\tAids in Digestive Health: Hyaluronic acid plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the gut lining, helping to reduce inflammation and support overall digestive health by keeping the tissues lubricated.\n\nAs hyaluronic acid levels decline with age, supplementing it can help combat these effects and promote overall health and vitality.\n\nComment Hyaluronic Acid to try it risk free."""

mlm,"""Do you ever feel like the person you see in the mirror doesn’t quite match how you feel inside?\nAging is natural, but looking older than you feel doesn’t have to be. I used to feel the same way until I started using collagen and hyaluronic acid – two powerful ingredients that truly transform skin from within.\n\nCollagen, the protein that gives skin its structure and firmness, starts to decline as we age, leading to sagging and wrinkles. By supplementing with collagen, you help rebuild that structure, improving skin elasticity, reducing fine lines, and giving your complexion a firmer, more youthful appearance.\n\nHyaluronic acid, on the other hand, is like a moisture magnet. It holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water, deeply hydrating the skin and filling in fine lines. The result? Skin that’s visibly plumper, smoother, and more radiant.\n\nNow, I feel like my best self – inside and out!\n\nIf you’re ready to look as young as you feel, comment GLOW or DM me and Let’s get your skin glowing with confidence again."""

Here’s a top tip: incorporate more vegetables and Omega-3s into your routine with beets, microgreens, and high-quality extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) like Oliveda’s. 🌿\n\nWhy Beets?\nBeets are a powerhouse for heart health and circulation. They’re rich in nitrates, which naturally boost blood flow, helping you stay energized and perform better physically. Plus, they’re loaded with antioxidants and fiber, which support digestion and help detoxify the body.\n\nWhy Microgreens?\nThese tiny greens pack a punch! Microgreens are concentrated with nutrients like vitamins A, C, and E, and they’re known to reduce inflammation, promote gut health, and even support your immune system. Add them to your salads, smoothies, or even on top of your avocado toast for an extra health boost!\n\nThe Truth About Omega-3 and EVOO\nOmega-3s are essential for brain, heart, and joint health, but did you know that not all EVOO is made equal?

mlm,"""I will never miss a day of our I01 Orac & Camu Camu Olive Leaf Extract. \n\nFor starters I like to boost my immune system daily with the highest immune boosting molecules and this product delivers! (No wonder I can’t remember the last time I was sick) 💛💛💛🎉🎉🎉\n\nAlso, I had no idea what ORAC meant until recently but it’s all about how molecules are absorbed. \n\nHere is what I learned hydroxytyrosol versus elderberry ORAC VALUE (think absorption) \n\nThe ORAC score of hydroxytyrosol is 27,000 and elderberry is around 14,000. This means it is better absorbed than elderberry and we all know elderberry is to help boost immunity. \n\nORAC is the oxygen radical absorption capacity. The ability of an antioxidant to neutralize free radicals (stopping them in their tracks -YAY‼️) \n\nCamu Camu berries are a powerful antioxidant too (HUGE) They have an ORAC score of 52,000. (WOWSA‼️) AND you guys, hydroxytyrosol is the ONLY polyphenol to cross the blood brain barrier! (DOUBLE HUGE‼️)\nThis is our most popular ingestible, hence why it has been hard to keep in stock. I take it every day, and I will not be without it now that I know how amazing it is for my body and my skin! \n\nThink Mediterranean diet on steroids for your body and your skin. Just imagine taking an olive leaf cell elixir daily that is full of antioxidants 3000-fold higher concentration of  than is found in olive oil. And Vit C that far exceeds the levels found in an orange by 30 fold (AMAZING‼️)\nThat’s our I01. 🫒🫒🫒🫒🫒🫒🫒\n\n20 years in Europe\n\n365 day return policy, \n\nand products that can’t stay in stock because their so crazy good. \n\nSafe for kids too.

mlm,"""HYDRATING PROPERLY CAN BE HARD. I’ve used electrolyte hydration drinks daily for a couple of years now but im excited to offer you natural precision peptides on Nov 1 and here is why \n\nUsing this “Hydrate” product could enhance the benefits of hydration  in several ways:\n\n\t1.\tEnhanced Absorption: With glycine improving fluid absorption, every sip you take becomes more effective, helping you stay hydrated faster and more efficiently. This can support quicker metabolic responses, energy boosts, and mental clarity.\n\t2.\tCoconut Water Power: Coconut water is naturally isotonic, meaning it helps replenish electrolytes more effectively than plain water. This can support heart health, improve stamina during workouts, and reduce fatigue, further aiding weight loss and physical performance.\n\t3.\tElectrolyte Support: Essential electrolytes from sources like SolarSea™ Sport balance hydration and help sustain energy. These electrolytes are crucial for muscle function and overall metabolic health, which are both vital for weight loss, cognitive function, and exercise recovery.\n\t4.\tBioactive Precision Peptides: The emphasis on ultimate hydration for maximizing the power of bioactive peptides suggests an additional layer of support for cellular health, which may further enhance muscle preservation and fat metabolism, especially when paired with products like “FIT” and “LEAN” for energy and performance.\n\nOverall, using this product would not only keep you hydrated but also provide added benefits that support your metabolism, exercise recovery, and energy levels, making it a more holistic approach to hydration. \n\nComment hydration if you want to try NPP."""

It’s ok I know you are busy and I want to be helpful. \n\nWhen we think about living longer, it’s not just about lifespan—it’s about health span and ultimately muscle span. Muscle isn’t just about strength; it’s a key organ that drives metabolic health, protects bone density, and even supports your immune system. As we age, protecting muscle becomes non-negotiable. Without it, we lose mobility, vitality, and resilience.\n\nThat’s where LEAN and FIT from Make Wellness come in.\n • LEAN: Perfect for anyone looking to optimize weight loss, this product targets visceral fat—the dangerous fat around your organs—while preserving lean muscle mass. Unlike harsh or invasive methods, LEAN’s natural precision peptides work with your body to support healthy metabolic function without unwanted side effects.\n • FIT: This is the ultimate muscle protector. FIT is designed to support muscle recovery, repair, and growth as we age. By keeping muscle mass strong and functional, FIT enhances your metabolic health, energy levels, and overall quality of life. It’s a must-have for anyone serious about aging well.\n\nWhy FIT is a Non-Negotiable for Healthy Aging whether you take LEAN or not and especially if you use Ozempic or the likes. \n\nAs we age, we naturally lose muscle mass—a process called sarcopenia—which can lead to weakness, fatigue, and increased risk of falls. But with FIT, you can combat this decline. It delivers targeted peptides to nourish and protect your muscles, ensuring that they remain strong and resilient. Adding FIT to your daily routine is like investing in your future health—it’s the key to staying active, independent, and vibrant for years to come.\n\nIf you want to lose fat, protect your muscle, and age with strength, LEAN and FIT are the answers you’ve been looking for. Don’t wait for your health to decline before taking action—start building the foundation for longevity today.\n\n📩 Message me with the word LEAN or FIT to learn how these products can transform your health!

I want to take a minute to share my personal story in hopes that it will/can help others. For about 17 years I have been on Adderall 20mg morning and 20mg noon. I have tried many times to taper off of it because I knew it was not good for me and every time I failed. About 3 months ago when I broke my arm (under doctors supervision) I cut back to 10mg in the morning and 10mg at noon. I could definitely tell my body was going through withdrawals!! (NOT FUN AT ALL!) I honestly felt like I was never going to be able to get off of this medication and to be honest, it SUCKED to say the least! So, about a month ago I started taking MAKE Focus and MAKE Energized (also Lean and Fit). I cut my 10mg doses down to 5mg for a couple weeks. I have now been COMPLETELY OFF of Adderall for over a week and only taking the Focus and Energized. I can not tell you how excited I am and how good I feel!! My doctor is SO impressed and so proud of me. To be honest I don’t know if I could have ever been able to get off this medication if it wasn’t for me being introduced to MAKE Wellness ❤️”\n💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛\n\nComment Focus if thhis speaks to you I will get you more information.

However, over time my \""as needed\"" has turned into \""everyday\"" because without it, I feel comparable to a bowl of jelly (extremely forgetful, unable to focus, no motivation, can't complete tasks, etc.) which often led to my anxiety spiraling out of control, too from feeling like I had no control over my own brain, scattered & unorganized, & not being able to accomplish things that I needed to get done. 🧠😭\n\nI recently shared that since starting FOCUSED roughly a month ago, I have completely replaced my second dose of medication with FOCUSED & haven't had to take my Rx once. Taking FOCUSED at lunch allows me to get through what is often the most hectic part of my day running kids to all the places at all the different times & fitting in laundry, dinner, homework, & a 2 year old in between it all without affecting my ability to fall asleep when I'm ready. 🙌🏻\n\nTo be able to substitute a medication I've had to continuously increase over time to simply get through my normal day to day with something natural, safe, & equally effective for me is something I didn't think was possible, especially during this crazy, busy stage of my life. 😜\n\n𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐞, 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐢𝐬 𝐇𝐔𝐆𝐄.

Together, we’ve helped countless women (and some men) transform their skin and confidence using the unparalleled power of the olive leaf elixir, hydroxytyrosol. By embracing waterless beauty, my clients have trusted me to guide them, believed in this innovative brand, and supported my business every step of the way.\n\nGrowing an organization from 0 to 113 partners this year didn’t happen because we kept the opportunity to ourselves—it happened because we shared it.

In an economy where flexibility, community, and purpose-driven work are more valuable than ever, network marketing provides an opportunity like no other.\n\nIt’s the perfect time to take a leap of faith. People are seeking solutions for their skin, health, and income. They’re looking for brands they can trust, for teams that inspire them, and for opportunities to build something meaningful on their own terms. Why not step into that gap and be the one to share what they need?\n\nLooking Ahead to 2025\n\nTo my incredible, intelligent, and driven partners who took a chance this year with Oliveda—thank you.

It took an extremely long time to find anything to help the pain at all and my mental health was in a terrifying place. \n\nMy loved ones were afraid to leave me alone. \nI didn’t want to live life in that circumstance. \nI felt like a burden to everyone around me. \nI was living a life I didn’t want. \n\nI was put on antidepressants and a high dose of them. They helped a little I guess… in the sense that they made me completely numb… 😕\n\nRight now, I feel HAPPINESS! \n\nIt’s been a week since I finally got a diagnosis after 4 years of fighting and it’s now been determined that I’m living with MS. \n\nMy mental health this time around as my health and life are changing, this is an opportunity for me to help other people in this struggle. It’s an opportunity how this business can be done as a family and how it can help circumstances that feel unmanageable in ways that are highly underestimated. \n\nEveryone has their own reasons and their own whys but if you’re looking for a way to feel your best and create a life based on freedom, I AM YOUR GIRL 🫶🏼\n\nPress follow to make sure msgs go through and reach out for details.

mlm,"""Vulnerable Post 🤍 \n\nI’ve been trying to find the exact words as to why I decided to navigate my online business team from Wellness to Beauty. \n\nIf I’m being honest, I think some of the critique put me in a limiting position to explain, it created an intimidation. But then I remembered, I’ve risen so much bigger than that, I just needed to break some things down for myself & my own mindset. \n\n•The fact that I feel the need to justify and defend my decision vs just explain my story is an example in itself. It’s my belief that you can’t judge someone else’s Mental struggle or their life decisions yet it’s coming to me from representatives of wellness. This isn’t a judgement towards others but it does not align with my feelings of wellness. \n\n•Nobody that has thrown me shade has ever asked for my why or my story before judging my integrity. I was a Mental Health advocate before I joined the Wellness space & I will be one after- in a way that feels good to me. \n\n•Along the same line, I’ve noticed that nobody critiquing me has a child to support or the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis & its limitations. I am doing the best that I can to support my family, Mentally, physically & financially. \n\n•When I talk about how Happy Juice saved my life & my mental wellness, I mean it. When I say that it will be a part of my daily routine, I mean that too. I’m drinking one as I make this post & I will always be available & happy to set people up on their HJ journey or answer any questions. \n\nWhen you join a business, a lot of us are joining at least partly for the community. I’m part of a warm hearted community now with a mentor that I’ve known personally for years and even worked with in the past. We’re close enough to host events, content shoots & team gatherings and that’s something I want in my life. \n\nIf it’s something you want in yours too- you’ve found the place to start that only tolerates positivity 🤍\nThat’s a part of my WHY- the rest requires its own post, that’s for sure. \n\nSpread kindness, it’s free 🫶🏼✨\n.\n.\n#beauty #wellness #onlinebusiness #mentalhealth #family #motherhood #multiplesclerosis #vulnerablepost #spreadkindness #nojudgement #femaleempowerment"""

mlm,"""🪱 Detoxing isn’t just for those with unhealthy habits. Our bodies constantly encounter hidden toxins in the air, water, and even ‘healthy’ foods—think pesticides, heavy metals, and microplastics. Even the most nutrient-rich diet can’t completely shield us. \n\n💦 That’s where a daily detox routine comes in, like zeolite. It helps bind and remove toxins that lurk unseen in the body, providing a level of cellular cleanse that diet alone can’t reach.\n\nI used to think detoxing was unnecessary too, especially since I was already eating healthy and doing everything “right.” But when I noticed lingering health issues, I realized that even the best diet couldn’t protect me from the hidden toxins in our environment. From pesticides in our food to heavy metals in the air, these toxins build up over time and impact our well-being in ways we don’t always see.\n\nAs a busy mom, finding a simple, effective detox routine became essential. Now, I detox daily—it’s an easy step that helps keep me and my family protected from everyday toxins without adding to my workload. \n\n💡 Ever wonder how I fit detoxing into my busy mom routine? \n\nComment “Detox” and I’ll give you all the details on my go-to solution—it’s a total game-changer!"""

Detoxing with the right tools, like natural zeolites or fulvic acid, can help remove harmful substances from your body while replenishing it with essential nutrients.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered, “Could there be a better way?”—this is your sign. Detoxing can reduce dependency on medications, restore balance, and unlock greater energy and focus. \n\nDrop a “Detox” in the comments if you’re ready to reclaim your health. Let’s embrace solutions that nurture, not just mask symptoms. 💪💚\n\n📲 Ready to start your wellness journey? Join us, and let’s detox and thrive together!"""
mlm,"""I always thought by 40, Botox would be my go-to. I mean, isn’t that just what we do when those frown lines start creeping in? 🫠 But I changed my mind—and my skin—without a single needle. 💉❌\n\nTurns out, the secret to glowing, smooth skin isn’t Botox… it’s detox. ✨ When I started cleansing my body of all the toxins we’re exposed to daily (think food, stress, pollution—yep, all the things), my skin transformed. My fine lines softened, my glow came back, and I feel more energized than ever. 🌿✨\n\nI recently discovered that Botox comes with risks such as toxin spread, muscle weakness, and side effects like drooping and bruising. 😬\n\nSo, who needs needles when you can detox your way to radiant, youthful skin? 🧖‍♀️💅 Want to know exactly how I did it?

mlm,"""Hey, moms! 💖 Did you know that 1 in 34 kids are diagnosed with autism? 😱 It’s a shocking reality that can leave us feeling scared and uncertain. \n\nDuring the pandemic, I took my little one to the pediatrician for her regular v@ccine dose, thinking it was just part of the routine. Back then, I was pretty clueless about the conversations swirling around v@ccines and their potential links to autism. Thankfully, she seemed fine, but then a year later, she was hospitalized with a serious ear infection after a possible exposure to s p ❗️k e proteins. \n\nWhen I asked the doctor if the vaccines were safe, he assured me they were, citing they were approved by the American Association of Pediatrics. But it definitely made me think, particularly after all the chatter about how the C 1 9 v@ccine was released in haste! 🤔 \n\nHere’s where it gets interesting: many moms are finding success with detox methods to help their kids feel better. I saw my friend’s child improve dramatically in just a week after detoxing! 🌈 If you’re interested in what she’s using and want to explore detox options for your little ones, drop a “Detox” below!

mlm,"""What have we done to our kids? Over-v@ccinating, over-medicating, over-diagnosing… and then came the masks, the lockdowns, and the forced separation from family, friends, and each other. The true character of a nation is revealed in how it treats its children—and we failed ours. Miserably. 😔\n\nI still think back to Thanksgiving 2020, when we crashed my in-laws’ place. I remember thinking, What’s the worst they could do? Kick us out? We showed up with a pre-made Thanksgiving dinner from Denny’s and called it a day. 🍽️ But you know what? We laughed, we ate, we shared stories. It wasn’t perfect, but it mattered. It mattered that my kids saw their grandparents before we moved states. 💕\n\nLooking back, it all makes my skin crawl. The fear the government and media pushed, the isolation they demanded. They didn’t want us talking, connecting, or even daring to think differently. They wanted us afraid of each other—terrified of human connection. 😷 That was my husband’s last Thanksgiving with his parents. His last with us. Christmas? Cancelled.🎄\n\nAnd the insanity didn’t stop there. My oldest daughter worked in Macy’s project in LA that year. They had a “C 🦠 V I D officer” who scolded her for standing too close to someone else. Separate tables, tents for every group. Honestly, it felt like a bad dystopian movie. 🙄\n\nThis Thanksgiving, I’m so grateful to put all that behind us. To just be together without fear, without restrictions, without guilt. Because our kids deserve better. They deserve family. They deserve connection. And so do we. 🦃💛"""

It wasn’t even a conscious decision—just peer pressure and trust in “the system.” And guess what? It made me sick.\n\nThe flu shot—those signs are everywhere: pharmacy counters, grocery stores, hospitals, and clinics. They’re handing it out like candy, as if it’s the ultimate answer. I gave in once, and I’ll never forget the regret. I was in bed for days, weak, achy, and miserable. I’ll never make that mistake again.\n\nI thought I was doing the right thing, just checking another box on my health to-do list. But within days, something felt...off. What started as mild symptoms spiraled into something much worse.

mlm,"""5 things to note before going for family planning✔✔\n\n👉The major point is that our body make-up differs, what works for A might not work for B\n👉But before embarking on any family planning, 1st pray any method you'll choose will work for you.....commit yourself into God's hand\n👉Then, go for family planning counselling to know more about the different methods plus searching on Google to know more about these methods \n👉If you are planning to go for IUCD, these are the points worthy of note;\n1. There are two types, there is hormonal and non- hormonal IUCD. The non-hormonal one is better e.g. Copper T, esp. for those that have lumps in their breast or had lumps removed from their breasts.\n2. Don't go for it if you normally have heavy period. Because, once inserted, it makes period to be more heavier esp.the 1st month to the 6th month, then it goes back to normal\n3. You have to be extraordinary neat while on IUCD. You can't afford to be slack with your vagina/menstrual hygiene because one of its disadvantages is that, it's highly susceptible to infection. You need to make use of high quality sanitary napkin and I will recommend Longrich Superbklean Sanitary Napkin.\nIt has features that answers every woman's choice of sanitary napkin\n1. Made of 💯cotton with 8 layers which holds 3x your regular pad\n2.Relieves menstrual pain\n3.Anti bacteria \n4. Anti inflammatory \n5. Eliminate odour\n6.Prevent and treat vaginal infection \n7.Enhances immunity.\n\n#TGIF\n#blossomdamainfamilyleader \n#yourpreventivelifestylepartner \n#teerichblossom \n#longrichrocks \n#daughterofgracefulbeauty"""

mlm,"""Four Things Network Marketing(NM)/Multi Level Marketing (MLM) is Not\n\n1. MLM is not a Get Rich Scheme: There is a time to plant, water & reap in NW. Hard (smart) work, consistency, Dedication & Focus is the key here.\n\n2. MLM is not a Ponzi Scheme: A ponzi scheme is illegal. It's a doubling scheme where you are asked to bring some amount for a larger amount. They don't have products/services & so they eventually crash.\n\n3. MLM is not a Pyramid Scheme: In a pyramid scheme, investors are well aware that the revenue they will generate comes from other investors.\nThey rob Peter to pay Paul.They get money from newer investors to pay older ones.\nThere is also no products/services. There is no source of creating legitimate revenue.\n\n4. MLM is not a Woman's Business: It is not gender sensitive. It's a business for anybody who badly desire change for their finances & who also has a big dream.\nThe money make in MLM is not just for women\nMLM is a level playing ground for everyone to make success on it.

general,"""THOUGHTS ON A CHANGING BODY || (through the pregnancy lens - but applies to other things too) \n\nTo answer the question asked in my stories … it absolutely is hard.\n\nThere’s no denying it. \n\nBut I would get you to question (or maybe even challenge) what ‘hard’ personally means to you in this context. \n\nI’d also ask if the downside of the ‘hard’ outweighs the upside… \n\nonly you can decide this (and I think we have to be mindful of not pressuring people into things in either direction - not our forté as a species). \n\nI can share some of my own perspective and experience thus far …\n\nPregnancy has been ‘hard’ in the sense that is has forced me to:\n\n- relinquish total control over my body - prompting me to ask myself if I ever really had much ‘control’ over it to begin with or did pregnancy just force me to face a primal physical intuition that is beyond a lot of the previously perceived levels of ‘control’?\n\n- Accept change - an arguably important reality we all have to face at some point in our lives (if not all the time in small/large ways). \n\n- Detach - from whatever identity I had created for it in relation to sport and performance (however I’m kind of looking forward to re-igniting this post pregnancy). \n\nAt the risk of sounding ridiculously earnest, I do want to say that I think life is a constant process of unfolding and pregnancy and child-rearing is just one direction of unfolding and evolving. \n\nIt’s not the be all and end all of what life has to offer and equally I have found it to be incredible and interesting and wild - thus far (like a weird science project that I get to witness in my body - obviously it’s much more than that too, I definitely don’t want to minimise it either). \n\nI think your questions are so valid and important and often come with a layer of shame because of many societal pressures. So thanks for giving me the opportunity to think about it 🩷\n\nThe answers can be harder to find without doing it but then once you’re doing it, there’s no rewind button ⏪ 😅 \n\nWhat is everyone else’s thoughts - pregnancy or not, our bodies change. Pregnancy just seems to do it in a short time frame (as does illness and injury and I would say grief too) 🤌🏽"""
general,"""NEW PODCAST OUT 🎧😮‍💨 | All about the physiological effects of all kinds of STRESS over time. \n\nAnd of course - how we can work to reduce it using a biopsychosocial approach (not just trying to out yoga/breathe/meditate dysfunctional patterns in our relational or cognitive behavioural patterns - because IMO it’s not possible). \n\nIf you’re stressed, you should listen. \nIf your body feels like it’s giving out, you should listen. \nIf you think life is great and everyone around you keeps creating problems for you, you should listen. \n\nand if you work with people in a health capacity - you should absolutely be considering the allostatic load. \n\nAll IMO obviously 🩷🙂\n\n#thevertuepodcast #allostaticload @vertue_podcast"""
general,"""TIPS FOR TRAINING AT HOME | anyone that says you can’t get good results from training at home is completely disregarding the fact that physical results don’t come from the environment that you train in, but the efficacy of the stimulus (or stress) you’re placing on your body, over time and whether you’re recording from that stress. \n\nHOWEVER; while the environment doesn’t solely determine the result, it absolutely can contribute to the motivation you have to engage with the health behaviour. \n\nOne tricky part about training at home is the fact that the place you will often train, is ALSO the place that you relax, eat, make love, have arguments, play, study, work … all the things. These associations can contribute (or detract from) our desire to workout in that space. The gym offers a new space with the energy (and associations) of other people training around you which can be inspiring for some (or potentially intimidating for others). \n\nBut going to the gym is not always possible so how can you transform your space and mental associations? I’ve shared some tips below:\n\n1. Train in a spare room, rather than a common room (or outdoors).\n\n2. Keep the equipment in your line of sight (it can be neat) but don’t tuck it away completely or you won’t be visually prompted to workout. \n\n3. Plan each of your workouts and try to stick to them for a minimum of 4 weeks to allow for those adaptations. \n\n4. Keep a simple sets and reps diary next to you while you workout so you can measure progress that doesn’t always revolve around the visual.\n\n5. Remember that by training at home you’re potentially also influencing your loved ones to do the same. Think of the perspective around exercise babies and children will have if they see you committing to training each day or week (sure, they might try to derail it sometimes, but humans learn much more through observation so it’s a beautiful and worthy cause that exists outside of yourself). \n\nWhat have I missed? What are some tips my Vertue Crew can share to help you feel more motivated to train at home when the gym just isn’t possible?"""
general,"""FLEXIBLE HIPS IN FOUR EASY MOVES\n\nThis is a more beginner friendly sequence than my last one - BUT let me tell you, I have worked with dancers, gymnasts and yogis who neglect their internal rotation work. So don’t be thinking that this is too beginner for you. I guarantee that internal rotation stretch will send you into a deep existential crisis that will eventually lead to the emancipation of a more enlightened Self. \n\nStretch 1: Internal Rotation (the intensity of this will depend on your height relative to your couch. If it’s not high enough, you may need to add cushions under your foot to increase the internal rotation). WATCH OUT FOR A HIKING HIP - keep your hips square. \n\nStretch 2: This is like a standing pigeon or standing 90 stretch and will really stretch the glutes well. If it’s not intense enough lean forward with a straight spine. \n\nStretch 3: Again look out for that hiking hip. If your hamstrings and inner thighs are stiff you’ll find your butt (on the side your stretching) wants to stick up and out. Try to drop it. \n\nStretch 4: Keep the knee close to the wall, tuck your tailbone and use a chair like @jwong.ok is doing to provide extra support for your upper body. \n\nHold each stretch for 1-2 minutes - add active isometric contractions at the end of each stretch for faster stretch gains (not sure what those are? DM me and check out my stretch programmes). \n\nSend this to your favourite stretch partner and get it into your daily routine. \n\nNot sorry about the intense morning face I have here - I really needed you to know that this is what I do when I first wake up. It takes no time at all and if you work as a desk, it’s the best for those stiff hips. \n\n#vertuemethod #vertuemethodstretch 🩷😮‍💨"""
general,"""BEFORE & AFTERS | Can we talk about them? \n\nI made choice a long time ago to NOT use B&A’s to advertise my programmes because I am passionate about people viewing physical activity as more than just what it might do for your body’s appearance. It felt like the narrative was skewed in favour of using them as the sole method for promoting health and fitness.\n\nBUT … now it feels as though the pendulum has swung and we are inadvertently shaming people for wanting to express the proudness they feel for the physical representation of their hard work over time. \n\nSomething about this narrative against the B&A isn’t sitting well with me anymore and I would love to unpack a few reasons why:\n\nReason 1: I feel like there’s a weird hypocrisy going on where we aren’t holding the same moral expectations to plastic surgeons and aestheticians for sharing B & A’s on the changes they are making to their clients faces or bodies in the way that personal trainers and other health and fitness businesses are. I’m not saying that we should be but I can’t really wrap my head around it. \n\nReason 2: Ultimately when we go after the health professionals for sharing B&As we are also unintentionally going after the people who are in those pictures. We are covertly suggesting that these people are a part of the problem because they are ‘proud’ of their transformation. \n\nWhy is this a potential issue?\n\nI think it causes many people to internalise their desire to make changes to their body (whether through surgery or fitness).

What is causing my backpain in pregnancy may not be the same for you and therefore this ‘fix’ I’m proposing is simply a sequence that is working for me.

general,"""Still sleeping with your ex? Here are five cognitive biases that are harming your health …. | NEW PODCAST ALERT\n\nCognitive Biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, where inferences about other people and situations may be drawn in a somewhat illogical fashion - and because they’re so quick we don’t even question whether they’re logic, we just behave as if they are. \n\nThese biases are often a result of the brain's attempt to simplify information processing.\n\nThere are obviously LOADS of these badboys but the five I discuss are:\n\n1. Anchoring Bias: This is the tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information offered (the \""anchor\"") when making decisions. ‘Carbs make you fat’ or ‘Weights make you bulky’ - if these were some of the first things you heard when embarking on a fitness journey - they are hard to shake. \n\n2. The Halo effect: Crudely put, this bias is when we trust hot people more than they perhaps deserve credit for … That was a very crude explaination and doesn’t quite hit it but I unpack a great study on this effect and how it impacted trustworthiness during the rona pano.*\n\n3. Action Bias: This is the tendency to favor action over inaction - feel the need to constantly change things up with your programme? Yeah this little bias might be the culprit and it’s getting in the way of results.\n\n4. The empathy gap: I loved this one the most because I make huge huge errors here. This is the bias that will have you thinking it’s perfectly fine to go over to your exes for a ‘catch-up’ convincing yourself that you definitely won’t hook up.\n\n5. Fundamental attribution error: This is the tendency to place an undue emphasis on internal characteristics to explain someone else's behaviour in a given situation, rather than considering external factors. This one can really wreak havoc on our self-esteem and self-efficacy - how? You’ll have to listen. \n\nIt’s a 30 minute episode and it will not disappoint. As always the goal with the @vertue_podcast is to leave you with some food for thought that can be PRACTICALLY applied to your health and wellness journey TODAY."""
general,"""Pregnancy Weight Gain - some THOUGHTS 💭 AND SOME FACTS ✅👇🏾\n\nUnfortunately in many societies weight gain is associated with a bunch of stigma. Some of it comes from a broader societal influence and some of it originates within our own households, upbringings and experiences which ultimately interact with other psychological factors that eventually shape the views we have of the weight gain we experience in ourselves.\n\nOn the other hand, PREGNANCY weight gain tends to sit in this sort of grey area of ‘stigma’ where it’s kind of expected and yet when you’re going through it you still feel / notice the effects of this internalised stigma. \n\nHowever, this idea that we should be aiming for a skinny pregnancy (yeah I saw it on tiktok) is deeply misguided and dangerous. \n\nFirstly, gaining weight when you’re pregnanané is really important for the baby’s growth and development, as well as for the mother’s health during and after pregnancy.\n\nGaining weight during pregnancy, is not just the baby growing. There’s the weight of the baby itself, the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb, and the placenta. Together, these account for about 38% of the weight gain.\n\nThe rest of the weight is because your body is changing – your blood volume increases (by up to 50-60% - this is wild. Vampires would love us), there’s more fluid in your body, your uterus and breasts get larger, and we store more fat. \n\nMost of the extra fat is stored under the skin (subcutaneous) and typically goes to places like the hips, back, and upper thighs (I have a whole bunch on the back of my arms now too). This fat storage is unique to pregnancy and starts to build up mostly in the first 30 weeks, under the influence of the hormone progesterone.*\n\nAll of this contributes to the protection of your own body and the health of your baby.\n\nAnnoyingly, I know that the effects of individual body image and weight stigma can be more powerful than a statement like; “it’s good for the health of your body and your baby.” This, coupled with the feeling of surrendering your body to a primal and natural process, completely out of your control can be incredibly disorientating. \n\nContinued in comments 👇🏾"""

So because we can’t change our bone length (without invasive and awful, awful surgical procedures) all we’re reallly taking about here is getting lean. In reality you can do that by reducing calories - but is that really what you’re wanting? \n\nTHE GOOD NEWS \nYou can develop an athletic (with definition) body while remaining lean (or getting lean). AND you can do it from home or the gym. It takes consistency, enough protein (and carbs) and progressive overload (things getting harder over time). \nIf you’re wanting specific body parts to become more specific, you’ll want to choose exercises that maximise muscle growth in those areas. \n\nWait - GROWTH? But growth is a scary word for me when I actually want to go down a size: \n\nNever fear - muscle growth IS so beneficial for a number of reasons (that I will cover in future posts and podcasts).

general,"""CORE & MOBILITY 6 weeks POSTPARTUM 🩷\n\nDisclaimer: Every body is different, every pregnancy is different and every birth is different so it can be really tricky to produce content that is applicable to all. \n\nWhen it comes to Diastasis Recti (abdominal separation) the research is actually still a little scarce. I’m actually now questioning whether closing it, is as important as I once thought (more on this to come on the @vertue_podcast because it requires a lot of nuance that this app canny take). \n\nThe term *activation* is also a little misleading. The idea that certain exercises can ‘activate’ muscles as if they were previously ‘inactive’ is obviously not true. In reality, most muscles are always somewhat active to maintain posture and perform basic functions. The term suggest that these muscles are completely dormant without specific exercises which is confusing. BUT - taking time to become aware of your abdominal family (not just your rectus abdominus) is beneficial particularly when your abs have been in a stretched position for 9 months. \n\nI’ll be sharing much more on all of this and it’s not always related to pregnancy or postpartum people. \n\nHow is your ab training going?

It may just be where your body preferentially stores fat - lucky you! That doesn’t mean you should avoid training glutes. Having less muscle won’t help you have less fat. \n\nIf you’re lucky to have one of these in your gym (not all commercial gyms have these which is a shame) then make sure you execute it with a rounded back (yes there’s time and place for an extended back but it doesn’t emphasise glutes the same way). \n\nHave you tried this exercise?

Check-in prior to training; this takes a lot of honesty which can be difficult because we’re the most amazing liars when it comes to self-denial (or I am anyway).

general,"""The short answer is yes you can still exercise and there’s an argument that it will actually BENEFIT you (rather than deplete).\n\nThis is for anyone who is struggling with consistently bad sleep. \n\nThis is for the parents, the people who struggle with insomnia. The shift workers. But it’s also for anyone who is having some short term sleep issues. \n\nIt gets to the point where you’re so tired, the thought of exercise feels a bit ridiculous (even harmful), however you also know that sleep isn’t likely to get better soon and you can’t just go on avoiding exercise because that also makes you feel worse. \n\nSo what can you do?\n\nWell, a recent meta-analysis explored whether moderate physical exercise could mitigate these negative effects in rodents. The results indicate that exercise can indeed prevent cognitive impairments and anxiety-like behaviours caused by sleep deprivation, potentially through various molecular pathways, suggesting that exercise could serve as a preventative or therapeutic measure against the repercussions of sleep loss.\n\nI’m going to unpack this in full on my podcast but … in the meantime, the answer is mostly like to be: Exercise anyway. \n\nThe type and intensity might have to be slightly reduced until you have a good night sleep but it doesn’t have to stop and in fact you might actually reduce the other negative effects of sleep by pushing yourself to do it anyway.\n\nHere’s what I do:\n1. Reduce the length of my workouts - training for 20-30 minutes.\n2. Take a 60 minute walk with Ayana daily\n3. Train upper body (as it usually isn’t as demanding on my nervous system as a leg session).\n\nWhat do you do? I’d love to hear from the sleep deprivation crew in the comments 🩷\n\nMore details on the study:\nThe exercise in the study was mostly treadmill based (there was one resistant based training protocol but you can’t really get rats doing CrossFit or power lifting yet - but I’m sure someone is working on it). However what they found was that 4 weeks of consistent daily treadmill work (60 minutes daily) produced these cognitive and anti-inflammitory benefits."""
general,"""TRAINING WITH A COLD | Can you? Should you? Especially when you’re kind of recovered but still have those really attractive phlegm-y symptoms… well, the research may surprise you (or be completely unsurprising and totally match your bias - in which case, yay for you - I love when that happens) 👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽\n\nBased on a review by Martin, Pence, and Woods (2010) research has shown that moderate exercise (50-70% HR) can reduce inflammation and boost the immune system against respiratory infections like colds and flu. The findings suggest that moderate exercise increases stress hormones, helping control inflammation, potentially enhancing the body’s antiviral defenses. This balanced immune response prevents excessive reactions that could cause harm. \n\nHowever, perhaps more interestingly (and annoyingly) prolonged intense exercise might tip the balance too much, making it easier for viruses to cause more severe illness. \n\nThe “J-shaped” model on the second slide illustrates that while sedentary people have a normal risk of infections, those engaging in low-to-moderate exercise have a reduced risk. Conversely, high-intensity exercise increases the risk of respiratory infections. Have any of you found this is the case for you too (especially when you undertake a new programme that has a lot higher intensity work?)\n\nWhat I took away from this research was that when you’re at that sort of end point of a respiratory virus, stay active, but keep it moderate intensity. \n\nDon’t rush back into your usual intense training as it might actually make things much, much worse. Also if you DO go back to that HIIT work (particularly prolonged) make sure you’re doing the necessary protocols to recover (reducing that allostatic load).\n\nSend this to that person who always seems to get sick when they start exercising again - maybe the intensity is too high, too soon?"""
general,"""If you feel disheartened, just remember that the body is trying to make you better at whatever you’re consistently doing. Sometimes that ‘consistency’ is hard to trust, particularly if it isn’t as ‘intense’ as you once had the capacity to handle. \n\nBut feeling disheartened can often lead us to things that definitely AREN’T in the direction of recovery. These are often:\n~ training too hard, too quickly\n~ changing your plan too often (because we don’t ‘trust’ it or a bored by it)\n~ completely giving up (only to be met with the pain or restriction of your injury again). \n\nTHIS IS WHERE SPORTS PSYCHOLOGY CAN HELP ⚽️ 🧠 there are many techniques within this domain but something that can be really helpful is cognitive restructuring. Now it comes from cognitive behavioural therapy but when used in a training context it can be a powerful tool for anyone dealing with injuries by helping you to shift your mindset from negative to positive. When you’re injured, it’s common to have thoughts like “I’ll never recover” or “This setback ruins everything.” Cognitive restructuring involves identifying these negative thoughts, challenging their accuracy, and replacing them with positive, realistic ones, such as “I can use this time to come back stronger” or “Recovery is part of my journey.” \n\nNow it’s not about cultivating toxic positivity - there are actually mental exercises you have to do (sort of like homework) to help you process and challenge these automatic (often negative) thoughts. \n\nI talk about this stuff a lot more on the @vertue_podcast in several different episodes. ❤️\nI’ll unpack more shortly 🙏🏽🧠\n\nDrop your favourite mindset tools for recovering from setbacks 👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽"""

general,"""Glad I don’t KNEE’D those crutches anymore. They finally got me Christopher WALKen. Okay, dad jokes aside…\n“Brace yourself” this is a long video and even longer caption. Last one 😂🫣\n\nA lot of people in the comments have been asking “what happened”, “how are you doing”, “when will you be able to walk”. Etc. I like to keep things light and funny on here. But when I first got hurt, Lindsey Vonn posted about her knee surgery and it made me feel less alone. So I decided to share my experience in the hopes that it helps others in the same situation find comfort or at least know what to expect on the long road to recovering from a torn ACL, meniscus and in my case, also a tibial plateau fracture. \nIt sucks. I’m not gonna sugar coat it. Sometimes the universe sends you a message that you don’t really want to hear. In my case, the universe wasn’t not asking… it was telling me to slow down. As someone who identifies as a “highly independent person” who is a “busy body” that can’t sit still, this has been an especially challenging time. Being immobile and having to be so dependent on others hasn’t been easy. Asking for help is even harder, but I haven’t had a choice. My community of friends, have really showed up for me in such a beautiful way. You know who you are. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Because the truth is, everyone talks about the physical pain (and yes it has been extremely painful) of an injury but seldomly do they talk about the mental toll it takes. I had a lot of anxiety when I first got injured, because I didn’t want to “bother” people or be an inconvenience. I’ve been really struggling with the loud voices in my head that keep saying “you’re a burden”. I have some work to do still in therapy. I’m learning that community is important. We can’t do everything all alone. My body has been so stagnant for so long, finally getting to move, and slowly start putting pressure on my leg has changed my mental state so much. I’m trying to be kinder to myself, to remind myself that this is temporary and it will get better. Since I started walking & traveling a bit I’ve been feeling much more positive, I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel💫"""

general,"""Well look at that: it’s Mental Health Month again! And what interesting timing for me, personally… let’s talk about it.\n\nThis year has tested me in so many ways, providing some of the best moments of my life while also finding new ways to kick me when I was down. It was infuritating—I had so much to be grateful for and so many aspects of my life were lining up just as I’d always dreamed… but all the same I felt this weight in my chest that kept pulling me down and not letting me up. But that’s how depression is. It’s not really concerned with what you consider to be convenient or rational, or ideal. And, this year, I really felt like quitting at times, and giving up. And it was only when I allowed myself to be honest about my struggle that I was finally able to begin the healing process. It was, once again, a turning point for me in my life when I was able to start a sentence about my own wellbeing with “I don’t mind…”. Admitting you need help is the only way to find it. I’m still a work in progress, and not every day is a good day. But I’m working on it. \nTake care of yourself. Be there for your friends and family, and show yourself the same compassion you would show your best friend. And while you’re at it, use this occasional toxic and negative platform for something positive and good. Because you CAN make a difference, and every time you chose to, you DO.\n\nI also want to bring in tons of money for @mentalhealthamerica this month so they can keep doing all the amazing work they’re doing, so buy this shirt and every other new item from the May collection at idontmind.com and make all of our hearts happy. 💪🎂💃 These folks make @idontmind possible!\n\nSending love and kindness to everyone, even the trolliest of trolls out there.

general,"""We hosted an event last weekend and as a part of the discussion, we identified how we can center emotional labor in how we advocate for a more just world.\n\nWe talked about how it can be used to subjugate. Emotional labor is present when you ask for what you need. It’s present when you tend to someone else’s feelings. It’s present when you advocate.\n\nEmotional labor can uphold gendered power imbalances. Many of us learn early on that there is safety in protecting men from shame. They may lash out at us or they may turn inward and shut down, withdrawing or spiraling out. We tiptoe, cater to and avoid conflict because we’re taught that men who feel sad, hurt or angry can be dangerous. Not just physically, but in other punishing ways.\n\nEmotional labor can also uphold racial power imbalances. A Black teenager at a store may notice a white woman clutch her purse. He may force a smile, make his body appear smaller or back away, mindful of his movements. He may feel hurt or frustrated, but maintaining her emotional comfort and making sure she doesn’t feel threatened is important in keeping him safe.\n\nEmotional labor can uphold ableist inequity. Being invited to a space and having access needs may require asking for accommodations. Having a need and knowing someone who has the ability to provide or deny means having to ask nicely and protect them from feeling guilty for not thinking of it. Wanting to be invited back means ensuring you aren’t upsetting anyone while still hoping to get the support.\n\nThe threat of emotional backlash, or punishment fueled by feelings, can have a significant impact on our relationships and organizations. \n\nOne thing we can do to create a more just world is take responsibility for our own emotional learning, our own emotional regulation and learn to communicate effectively. Being able to navigate conflict without blaming is important. Allowing yourself to feel hurt, challenged or ashamed without placing the burden of processing or protecting your feelings onto others.\n\nSo, sound off… What else can we do?\n(Pic: @jbg_photo )"""

general,"""This sound went viral late 2022. If you’re not familiar, the Bluey song names the characters - “mum”, music, “dad”, music, then bingo and bluey. Folks used it by showing a clip or something moms did, then cut to what dad was doing at the same time. Variations of it were:\n\n- Mom cooking dinner with kids hanging on her. Dad fumbling even without the kids around.\n\n- Mom doing childcare while sick. Dad sick in bed.\n\n- Mom packing and carrying all the bags to the car. Dad wandering, face in phone behind them.\n\nAnd the most popular by far was this one… mom handling things while dad hid out in the bathroom.\n\nThis narrative is tired. It captures differing gendered expectations. It captures exaggerated beliefs about who does one does not/should and should not feel responsible for caregiving. It normalizes this dynamic. \n\nThere are also nuggets of the tragedy of the nuclear family here. Working through illness. Struggling to manage unending demands from work and home. In a society that isolates us and discourages us from getting the support we need, the bathroom can be a momentary safe haven. Regardless of gender, many caregivers have experienced escaping to the bathroom for a break. \n\nThe trick is not letting society’s overwhelming demands pit us against one another. It’s giving one another breaks in considerate ways, noticing the work we’re all doing and showing up in ways that lighten the load rather than pushing it off without acknowledgement or consent.\n\nWe can do better!

(queue dropping out of university.) \n9. work on taking criticism better. it’ll help a lot in the future. \n10. that gut creepy feeling you get around certain people- listen to it. trust yourself. you were always right about them. \n11. that boy you’re in love with doesn’t even cross your mind now. i promise he is not the end of the world. \n12. scrappy died 2 years ago, but you got through it. you have a macey now, and she’s yours. she’s amazing. you would’ve loved her. kitty also is here and she’s obsessed with mom now ever since you went to camp, so she says hi but from afar.\n13. don’t paint your room orange\n14. you are so special and important, and anyone who doesn’t see that doesn’t deserve you in their life\n15. you will go through very hard times, but you always survive. i am so proud of you. i hope you’re proud of me."""

general,"""continuing on the topic of lessons I learned through my years in the gym..\n\n🧘🏻‍♀️ TOOK MY REST DAYS MORE SERIOUSLY and understood the importance and value of them. that rest is also growth and they are crucial in the process of building muscles. I used to train 6-7 days /week. today I train 3-4 times /week\n\n🥘 FOOD ALIGNED WITH MY GOALS AND ACTIVITIES to make sure to not undereat. I used to eat way less calories than what my body needed and this really prevented me from reaching my goals\n\n👀 CONSTANTLY CHASING NEW EXERCISES was a trend back in the days and we lost our way. instead of trying to invent the wheel again, stick to a plan!!! the longer the better. be the absolute best you can be on a few exercises, track, overview and progress!\n\n🏋🏼‍♀️ LESS EXERCISES / SESSION (as mentioned 2 days ago) I used to do over 7+ exercises in one session back in the days. By the time I got to the end of the session I was so fatigued and had no energy to complete the workouts and had to force myself into doing the rest. today I do 4-5 exercises per session which allows me to put 100% quality and focus into those exercises.\n\n✖️DOING 12/15+ REPS FOR EVERY SET AND EXERCISE\nwhen I started to switch reps from 12-15 reps in all exercises and all sets, to 5-7, 6-8, 8-10 that’s when things started to happen. think of it like this, if you can do 12 reps x 3 sets of the same weights, you’re not pushing yourself enough! we need progressive overload and mind muscle connection. we want quality. today I do all from  5-7 reps for my heaviest sets where I train to failure/close to failure which is crucial part for muscle growth. to 8-10 reps and 12-15 reps as my back-off sets\n\nHope this helps 🫶🏼 \nloads of love xx"""

In Australia, men are responsible for the vast majority of violence against women, and this isn’t an isolated or random occurrence. It’s a pattern fueled by societal expectations, gender roles, and the normalisation of violence as a tool of control. Acknowledging this gendered element is essential to understanding the true nature of family and domestic violence. \n\n#16daysofactivism #16daysofactivismagainstgenderbasedviolence #auspol"""

I immediately unhooked the line & loaded her… \n\nI was sure she would be down by the time we got there, but she was standing, her HR was now 100+. They got her in & started diagnostics. They couldn’t get a tube passed (why her nose was bleeding) & her stomach was about to rupture. They scoped her to see why the tube wouldn’t pass & she just wouldn’t swallow it… They got a tiny tube & guided it with a scope to get it to the stomach. They pulled a ton of reflux off her stomach which relieved a lot of the pain.\n\nHer abdominal lactate was bad, but the color was good, so the initial suspicion was that it was an enteritis or ileal impaction. She declined over the next 8 hours. She had continual reflux, they weren’t getting ahead of her hydration & her pain was increasing. They reultrasounded her & saw a pretty definitive ileocecal intussusception. Basically the intestine telescopes itself. The only fix is surgery & she was not a candidate. \n\nWhen we got into the recovery box to euthanize her - she got really nervous. Started head ticking & sitting back on her hind legs heavier. I asked them if we could do it outside in the grass. They don’t like to do the draft without the support wall, but I told them I was aware that she could fall really hard & it not be pretty. Initially they pushed not to, but I just did not want her to leave scared. We walked her outside & her ears immediately perked up. She stood calm in the grass & laid down beautifully. She went easy. \n\nIt’s been a hard 24 hours. Please consider a final gift to Diane for her years of abuse & service she didn’t deserve 💔"""
general,"""Our sweet, sweet baby 🥹\n\nAfter her first surgery, her respiratory effort became increased & after ultrasound & radiographs - it was confirmed to be pneumonia. Her mom tested positive for EHV1 m, however the foal’s test came back negative. She’s already on systemic antibiotics for her leg, but they’ve added nebulization which is helping a lot so far. \n\nThe pneumonia adds a lot of complications to the orthopedic side of things. It’s very risky to use anesthesia on animals with compromised lungs like this - especially a foal. Thankfully she is such a good baby - they were able to lavage the joint, implant new antibiotics beads, inject an antibiotic & rebandage with just a local block. She’s sore, but using the leg more & more which is the best we can hope for so far 🙏🏽\n\nShe unfortunately scratched her cornea somehow while in hospital… She wasn’t responding to the initial schedule of med applications, so they had to increase this to applying every 2 hours. This adds a fair bit of cost to the bill, however we are hoping in a few days they can go back down. Both mom & baby also got a lice bath ❤️‍🩹 \n\nWith the eye complication - we could use all the help we can get with their climbing bill 🏥 The mom is such a kind Jenny & the little one - well she’s just the best.

Julep was a ex racehorse who was used as a broodmare in Kentucky for most of her life. She landed here with us to live out her last days. She was blind in her right eye & was your typical antsy thoroughbred. She was also the one mare ALL the boys fought over lol. \n\nThe last 6 months Julep had been struggling with chronic laminitis. We got ahead of it for a while with custom orthopedic shoes, but this last cycle she abscessed & we had to pull her shoes to soak & bandage her hooves. With her age & the chronicity of this, we decided this was an ongoing battle she didn’t need to fight. \n\nShe spent longer hours lying down in the pasture the past week & we knew was ready. I didn’t want to trailer her, so a vet came out to euthanize her. We laid her to rest in the trailer, so my dad could bury her at our other property next to her BFF, Mystic. \n\nShe laid down gently & went very, very easy. Her body was tired. She lived a loved 5+ years with us. Rest easy sweet JuJu ❤️‍🩹🌈🕊️\n\nPlease consider small donation towards Julep’s final gift. It wasn’t terribly expensive since my dad is able to bury her.

general,"""Cue “Magical Princess Unicorn” 🦄🏰👑\n\nThis beautiful girl is so full of life! She still has a long way to go in her physical healing. Her surgery to remove the melanoma around her vulva & anus is scheduled for June 17th. They could barely get more than a few fingers in to rectally palpate her. If the tumors aren’t removed - eventually, as they grow larger, she won’t be able to pass manure. It will be done in two parts to reduce the amount of trauma at once to the delicate area & maximize success. They will also remove the rather large third eye lid tumor on her left eye while she is there. \n\nOnce we tackle these & she has time to heal - we can treat her lips with a chemo injection. They are HUGE, but it’s a really hard to surgically remove these due to the skin, tension, constant motion, etc. so the chemo route is preferred. \n\nThe care she needs isn’t going to be cheap. We have had huge medical expenses this month with many more to come. This mare, the donkeys & Munchie’s all started as something small & very manageable/treatable. They are now huge issues because their previous humans failed them so miserably. They all deserve the care they need, they all want to live & despite their pain & challenges - they live with such radiant & joyous spirits. \n\nThese vet bills are on top of our primary vet bills, feed, hay, farrier, daily supplies, medicine, etc. Deworming alone was $1,000 this month. It’s a lot & we really need support for these beautiful animals if you are able to donate or join our Patreon as a monthly donor.

general,"""Unpopular opinion - mares are so much easier than geldings. \n\nNo one will ever convince me that mares are just moody or geldings are so much quieter. Mares are like women and geldings are like men lol. The geldings fight & get possessive of the girls constantly. They are needy, get so attached, fight each other, cause drama. Then there’s our mares. They all get along with each other, any initial issues are worked out & then never an issue again, they share food without fights, they don’t start trouble or mischief. They are so intelligent, so willing & always put 110% in. They won’t however just submit, feel safe or be easy going if they don’t feel Iike their feelings are being heard or acknowledged. \n\nIgnoring mares feelings and saying “it’s just because they’re just a mare” is reactive abuse. You do something that bothers them, they probably warned you 500x & you still ignore it, finally they lash out & then they are the “villain”. This is true for both geldings & mares, but mares, atleast in my opinion, are more emotional & intelligent. They have to be to be mothers & raise their foals. The boys… well they are a little more “simple minded” lol. \n\nMaybe I’m the 1% that thinks this, but with our mixed herds in large pastures - the girls are so easy. The geldings... well Frodo explains the love hate with them in this video 🤣"""

general,"""Today is the day she gets her chance. \n\nShe was dumped at a sale barn, with cancerous lesions in her mouth, anus and vulva, as well as several other growths on various areas of her body. They put a bit in her cancerous mouth and rode her through an auction ring - never disclosing her cancer to the bidders.\n\nWe knew though. We assessed her prior to the sale and knew if we didn’t intervene - she would be in danger of either being dumped right back in the circuit - passed around getting sicker and sicker - or end up in the wrong hands of someone not equipped or willing to provide treatment and sanctuary. To bridle her, saddle her, ride her with cancer anyways. It’s exactly why we rescued her. She deserves unconditional love, treatment and rest. \n\nTo add more heartache, when assessed by the vet - they determined she had milk. Meaning she recently had a baby pulled off her. Not only did they leave her cancer untreated - she grew and BIRTHED a foal with a cancerous body and cancerous genitals. The pain of that. I cannot imagine.\n\nIt makes me so angry. So sad. So upset for her. \n\nBut we are here now - rallying to do right by her. \n\nIf 1,000 people donate 5 dollars - we will finish raising the cost of her surgeries, 4 weeks of hospitalization she will need as well as the chemo injections for her mouth and cover the cost of getting her out of that hell hole. \n\nRescue is SO MUCH MORE than the initial pull to safety. The real rescue comes AFTER - to provide care and ALL of the chances they deserve. \n\nChristina from Freedom Reins has lovingly taken this beautiful girl in to both provide treatment and sanctuary her for the rest of her life.

general,"""Regina & Sarah ❤️ \n\nAn ex Amish Belgian & an orphaned saddlebred baby. Draft mares are the of epitome strength & resilience yet they never lose their willingness to be vulnerable & empathetic. \n\nWe always let our horses decide who they are friends with & feel safe with them when we bring them in for feedings - we keep their friend groups together. I don’t quite understand it yet, but every orphan foal we have rescued has had an immediate connection with one of the draft mares (Moosette, Diane, Regina, Madonna). So much so that many try nursing for weeks if not months…\n\nWhat’s really profound is every draft mare has without hesitation has taken them in & protected them as their own. Bambi & Flower were like little ducklings following Moosette before she had Max. Sarah hasn’t left Regina’s side since we rescued Regina almost 18 months ago & Frodo immediately saw Diane as her mom… 🥲 \n\nNala is the exception & has taken in Sebastian & Diamond. Diamond & Sebastian had to stay in a small paddock with some stall rest due to both physical development issues & mental trauma. They ended up bonded heavily to each other during that initial year & now they are mostly with Nala. Regina & Moosette babysit them time to time though lol. \n\nOur other mares (non draft) are wonderful. They all protect the babies & keep the bully geldings on the outskirts away from them, but they haven’t taken on that true “mother” role. We might get a horse that changes this pattern in our rescues, but so far it hold tried & true. It’s beautiful to witness because the love between the orphan foals & the draft mares is true & unconditional - it’s not based on breed, looks, what they can benefit from or take.

general,"""Fiona 🥹 \n\nIt’s so good to have her home. I was so worried we weren’t going to get her through this most recent flare up. Her injuries are extensive - two hind tendon injuries (one having been completely ruptured) along with a  front left with coffin bone/navicular changes. Someone crippled her beyond belief. She didn’t deserve what happened to her. It takes dedication to keep her comfortable & maintain these injuries to keep her pasture sound, but she’s worth it 1000x over ❤️"""

general,"""My sweet Spike 🕊️🌈💔\n\nSpike was surrendered last year with Gus by an elderly man who had onset of dementia. He was used as a cow horse before retiring about 4 years ago. He was a saint & the horse I trusted most out of all the rescues even though our time together was short.\n\nHe was 27 years old & thankfully never had to endure an auction, kill pen or the slaughter pipeline. While no necropsy was done - Spike appears to have passed from sudden cardiovascular death. He spent the entire day hanging out with us on Sunday & he was his bright, happy self. Monday he was gone. He had no struggle marks, no sweat marks even on his down side & he was still clean/groomed. \n\nFrom what I could see he was walking down the hill & collapsed. He kicked three times with his left hind & was gone. He had a cut on his rump, but I put a glove on & thoroughly checked it. I’m not sure where he got it, but it was superficial & did not appear related in any way. He lived an easy leisure life here, so I can’t say I noticed any clear symptoms of heart related issues such as exercise intolerance. He was able to just be a happy old man & go at his own pace like he deserved. \n\nOf course I have a million what if’s running through my head & it’s hard not having that clear cut diagnostic of what caused this... It makes me think of all the 1% of possible causes for sudden death that could affect more than just him. Spike was one of my favorite horses & I’m devastated. I cherished having him around, but I don’t have time to grieve this week. I wanted to cry yesterday, but I didn’t. Compartmentalizing so heavily takes its toll long term, but sadly it is needed in rescue. I have to focus on Flora, her surgery & getting her fundraiser done before Thursday."""

general,"""We need help & donations. Only a handful of people have stepped up for OptiMoose’s emergency & we haven’t even got to hay, farrier or Blue, Gus & the other’s vetting. I can’t go to auction every month & fundraise/take new animals in with caring for so many special needs/hospice cases we have here.\n\nSaving animals from auction is needed - most of these are auction saves, but a lot of them need soft landings. Please remember to support smaller sanctuaries because it’s getting harder & harder for us. Blue’s vet bill is around $3,500. If he were at auction next weekend the money would get raised, but since he’s in a sanctuary it doesn’t get much attention. Horse rescue has so many different working parts. It’s not just auction. It’s local, its owner surrenders, its sanctuary, its legislature. It’s not just auction. It is no secret that auction is the easiest way to raise funding. Saving new lives is wonderful, but we have to stay committed to the lives already saved right? I only say this so awareness can be raised for rescues that don’t attend auction monthly b/c our ability to keep up continues to get harder.\n\n#horses #animalrescue #animals"""

Anya then applied a creamy, anti-inflammatory base enriched with retinol, glycolic, salicylic acid, and hyaluronic acid, followed by a soothing emulsion and facial steamer to address brightness and texture.\n\nShe even noticed my eyes looked off—a result of being sick for a month—and focused on healing them as well. This attention to detail was so thoughtful!\n\nExtractions came next, which were a little painful but totally worth it for clearing clogged pores, blackheads, and impurities. Anya used a high-frequency wand afterward to disinfect and promote healing, and she convinced me to invest in my own device for at-home care.\n\nThe highlight of the session was her relaxing scalp and lymphatic drainage massage with her custom jojoba-based cream infused with vitamin C, retinol, and salicylic actives. This melted away my tension and even radiated calm energy to my daughter, who was with me.\n\nTo finish, Anya used an ultrasonic cold therapy device to lock in moisture and gave me the most beautiful glow."""

She’s always so curious to play with them so I’ve been learning to release my fear and trust that she will be mindful. If we don’t grant a child or person the chance to grow from an opportunity, we are potentially blocking them from learning that lesson. Its a process, but I’m now trying to hold back when I feel the urge to remind her to be careful so she won’t instil that fear and feel safe to make mistakes. She has to build her own self-confidence and learn to believe in her abilities. It’s been nearly 2 years and I still haven’t felt the need to hide my bowls from her. As her mama, I’m so proud of her mindfulness and compassion towards our delicate healing instruments.

general,"""The story behind my collaboration with Atoms for a sneaker: I think my favorite video I’ve ever made was when I got to interview Kobe Bryant (during his farewell tour season, in the basement of the Staples Center). I was obviously pretty awestruck, (it was my first interview ever) but I also came away from that super impressed with his approach to creating his own sneakers. He had an incredible amount of input into all of the details of his own signature shoe, and it showed. Turns out that’s pretty rare for a signature shoe athlete.\n\nFast forward a few years, and when Atoms approached me with their vision for a completely new sneaker, I was immediately intrigued. Now I won’t name names, but I’d actually gotten that pitch before, but it turned out to essentially be a chance to slap my name on something that was almost finished… not interested in that. But Atoms was completely game to start from scratch and create something completely new… I couldn’t say yes fast enough.\n\nThis was in 2020, and I was straight off to the drawing board, firing ideas at Atoms designers and experts, and figuring out what could work, what couldn’t, what would cost more, what would cost less, etc. It quickly grew into a deep collaboration between myself and the Atoms team. We shared a passion for design and innovation, and we knew that we could create something truly unique together.\n\nSo if you haven’t already, I encourage you to check out the result of the MKBHD x Atoms collaboration. It represents my best ideas as a product enthusiast, and a sneakerhead for a comfortable, versatile, daily wear shoe. It's only available for a limited time, and it's a chance to own something truly special. Thanks for your support, guys, and as always, stay tuned for more!\n\n#WearYourKicks"""

general,"""I love electric cars, but as I've said on the Auto Focus channel there are certain TYPES of vehicles that with today's tech are BEST when made electric. Take a luxury sedan - what do you want from the best one? It better be super smooth, comfortable, quiet (and probably expensive). A new electric version? Literally the smoothest, quietest, most spacious version ever. (also probably expensive). Total win across the board. \n\nBut sports cars are not one of those things. Yet. The power is there, duh, but there's also a ton of weight that comes with it. And the best sports car across the board rivers best when it's lighter, nimble and reliable. The gap is closing (and hybrids are getting VERY good) out the apex sports car is still not fully electric. \n\nHonestly I was nervous to get it after watching basically every review on the internet proclaiming this to be the \""best car ever created\"" and \""too good\"" but the professionals were on to something. I'm not ready to say it's the best car ever made, but most of its traits are already top 5% of any car I've ever experienced: Handling, steering feel, balance, physical switches, interior build quality, speakers, acceleration (ok it's 8/10ths as quick as PLAID)\n\nThe tech is actually kinda bad compared to new EVs. The backup camera is weak, there's no phone key, the app does almost nothing, no dashcam, wireless CarPlay/Android Auto are welcome but also honestly still not very good. I don't even think that's a hot take.\n\nI've compared smartphones to the Porsche 911's incremental improvement model for years. When the category is young, we call it lazy. When the category is mature, we call it refinement. And I'm only 700 miles in, but damn this car is REFINED as hell.\n\nSo this is the new daily 🤓 It's no Carrera GT (♥️ @dougdemuro) but it's MY Turbo S and i love this thing\n\nFor the Porsche nerds\n2024 992 Turbo S\nJet black metallic + Stealth PPF\nPASM, PCCB, Sports Aero, Front axle lift, glass roof\nChalk stitching\nCarbon mirror caps, door trim, GT steering wheel\nWheels powder coated, brakes painted and glossy hood stripe by @autopolishingcenter\n\nIs there a 992.2 hybrid refresh coming?

general,"""The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck isn't the pointy corners. It isn't the blind spots or the blinding glare off the stainless steel in the sun or the way the front trunk closes. No. The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is how it makes everyone else around you on the road behave 😭\n\nI've seen people accelerate and cut people off to get a video of the truck on their phone WHILE driving. I've seen people stop in the middle of a one way street to take a picture of it parked. I've seen people wobble around in their lane and damn near leave the road trying to get their phone out of their pocket as it passes by. I pulled into an intersection once and two kids in bikes straight up biked into the middle of the intersection to get a nice snap of it. I have hundreds of sentry mode clips of more - people looking inside, stopping in their tracks - probably 75% in awe and 25% in disgust lol.\n\nThe Cybertruck is - at least right now - a celebrity. No idea how long this will be true or how long until they're mass produced and everywhere in the road and this all wears off. But what I can tell you today is if you don't like attention... if you don't want a conversation EVERY time you park... if you don't want EVERYTHING you do on the road recorded... don't get a Cybertruck 😅"""

In modern dental care, lost or severely damaged teeth are typically replaced with dental implants, bridges, or dentures rather than attempting to transplant teeth from deceased individuals.\n\nThe use of human tissues for transplantation must follow strict protocols to ensure safety, and teeth transplantation from deceased individuals to living patients does not meet these standards.\n@zackdfilms 🫥🫥"""

Brushing aggressively can wear down the enamel—the protective outer layer of your teeth—and lead to gum recession. Both of these issues increase sensitivity and make your teeth more susceptible to decay and other damage.\n\nHere’s how to brush effectively without overdoing it:\n\n\t1.\tUse a soft-bristled toothbrush: Hard bristles can be too abrasive for teeth and gums.\n\t2.\tBrush for 2 minutes: Brushing twice a day for about 2 minutes each time is ideal. Don’t brush for much longer.\n\t3.\tGentle pressure: Apply light pressure, as if you’re massaging your teeth, not scrubbing them.\n\t4.\tUse the right technique: Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle to your gum line, and use small circular motions rather than back-and-forth scrubbing.\n\nPracticing gentle brushing habits can help protect your enamel and gums for the long run."""

The hard metal or acrylic part of a tongue ring often comes into contact with the teeth, especially when chewing, talking, or even accidentally biting down on it. This impact can create small fractures or chips, and over time, it can lead to more significant damage, like cracking or breaking teeth entirely. Additionally, tongue rings can increase the risk of gum recession, enamel wear, and infections due to bacteria buildup.\n\nIf you’re thinking about getting or already have a tongue ring, it’s essential to be aware of these risks and take precautions, like using softer materials (if possible) and being mindful of the jewelry’s position. Regular check-ups with a dentist can help catch any early signs of damage \n\nWho loves Tongue 👅 Rings ?"""

This is why young children should use only a small, pea-sized amount and be supervised while brushing.\n\nIn large quantities, fluoride can cause issues like fluorosis (white spots on teeth) or, rarely, more serious toxicity.

Inflammation and bacteria in the mouth can affect the heart, especially if gum disease (periodontitis) goes untreated. Here’s how they’re linked:\n\n\t1.\tBacteria and Inflammation: When you have gum disease, bacteria from your mouth can enter the bloodstream. This bacteria may cause inflammation, which can contribute to the formation of plaques in arteries—a process known as atherosclerosis. These plaques narrow arteries, potentially leading to cardiovascular issues.\n\t2.\tEndothelial Damage: The inflammation from gum disease may damage the endothelium, which is the thin membrane lining the heart and blood vessels. Damage to this layer increases the risk of plaque formation, blood clots, and eventually, heart attacks or strokes.\n\t3.\tIncreased Risk for Heart Attack and Stroke: Studies have shown that people with periodontal disease are more likely to have heart disease. The relationship isn’t entirely understood, but inflammation seems to play a significant role. This inflammation could potentially lead to a higher risk of heart attack or stroke.\n\t4.\tDiabetes Connection: Since people with diabetes are at higher risk for both gum disease and heart disease, the connection between these diseases becomes even more critical. Proper oral care is particularly important for those with diabetes to reduce their cardiovascular risk.\n\t5.\tPreventative Measures: Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups can help reduce oral bacteria and inflammation. By keeping gum disease in check, you may also reduce your risk of heart disease."""

general,"""#Ad As a dermatologist, the number one skincare mistake I see people make is avoiding sunscreen, because they are worried it will break them out. If that is you, I recommend you to try out @eltamdskincare UV Clear sunscreen. Specifically created for acne prone skin and rosacea, it has 5% niacinamide to visibly improve skin tone and discoloration. It is formulated to calm and protect acne-prone skin, & helps keep your skin smooth and even. And NO it won’t clog pores, as it is super lightweight, non-comedogenic formula that is both safe & beneficial for acne prone skin.  It layers well under makeup, and there is even a tinted version of UV Clear. Sunscreen is important year round!

general,"""Which is your favorite? 🥰\nThe last 3 years were of great pain, losses & hardships but they also brought so much necessary healing and growth. I was challenged in the hardest of ways. I didn’t think I’d ever see the light when I felt swallowed in the dark, but here I am finally basking in it. Thankful I pushed through the healing because I’m a better mother, friend, wife and woman.\n\nIn moments seeing my family like this, it just makes me so unbelievably joyful. Having moments captured will forever mean so much to me and I know they’ll continue to bring an abundance of joy when I look at them as an old lady. 👵🏽 \n\nThank you all for the congratulations and well wishes. We are so excited and (a little scared ) but mostly overjoyed for baby #3 to join us. 🤍\n\nIf you’re struggling with ppd, dark seasons, HARD seasons, hang in there. Keep fighting for yourself, for your healing…darkness may make you feel broken, but remember cracks allow the light to shine through. 🫶🏽"""
general,"""I have to give exercise a big thank you this pregnancy because I have been sooo moody. More than I was in my other two! \n\nExercise has helped tamed and calmed this mama. 🤣 bless @jhalliday14 for putting up with me so graciously!\n\nPersonally, knowing the health benefits of exercise not only for me, but for baby as well, always gives me that little extra push to work through that initial tiredness. \n\nMy workouts almost always ends up giving me the energy I so desperately need! Not only that, but it’s such a mood stabilizer and booster.\n\nBUT! That does not mean you should push yourself through exhaustion. There’s so many barriers to exercise to begin with, pregnancy makes it that much harder.\n\nSo please have grace with yourself. I’m speaking for what personally has been helpful for me.\n\nRest is needed during first trimester. It’s important and necessary. 👏🏼 So if your body needs the rest, that’s what it needs.\nPeriod.No guilt.

Very quickly.\n\n👏🏼Zero pelvic girdle pain so far and I’m so thankful. \n\n🤜🏽That morning bump vs night bump #hellobloating grows like 6 weeks in a few hours! \n\nPregnancy can be so hard. It’s so individual. Your symptoms, how you carry & feel. Accepting your body changing isn’t always an easy journey for so many. I’ll always say you can simultaneously struggle with change while also being incredibly grateful.\n\nI see so often women being afraid to be honest about their experiences (both positive & negative) during pregnancy bc the judgment and shaming is so harsh or they don’t want to make anyone feel bad. It can easily steal someone’s joy.\n\nSome of the most powerful ways we can support others is just by listening, even if it differs from our experience 🫶🏽\n\n#pregnancy #pregnant #fitpregnancy #17weekspregnant"""
general,"""My kids simultaneously gave me away while also having my back😂 \n\nI rarely use sarcasm, so if this is unclear, this video is complete sarcasm. My kids are eating a giant bowl of cereal as we were late for school 🤗\n\nBut on a serious note, kudos to those who do wake up at 3:30/4am to get it done. It’s pretty badass. I’ll be inspired by you and apply to my life in other ways.👊🏼\n\nHowever, I simply will never be someone willingly getting up at 4am to have zen mornings. I’d never be a pleasant person to be around if I did. \n\nI’ll choose the bit of chaos for the extra sleep. So if you’re a family like mine, it’s okay to have some chaos & cereal. You’re still killing it. 👏🏼\n\nNever feel guilty if you can’t get it all done before your kids get up! \n\nFind what works for you. There’s a million in one ways to prioritize yourself and sometimes that’s choosing the extra sleep or it’s getting up early. They both can be prioritizing yourself. 🫶🏽\n\n#parenting #fitnessmotivation #reality #sarcasm"""
general,"""You are not broken during pregnancy but you are also not invincible. 👏🏼\n\nPressure seeks a path of least resistance. \n\nYour connective tissues and pelvic floor are more susceptible to pressure & potential injury due to ab separation from growing baby.\n\nWe know lifting is wonderful during pregnancy. 👊🏼\n\nBut we also know lifting increases pressure in our core canister, especially when coupled with breath holding techniques + load.\n\nBecause of this, minimizing extra stress to the abdominal wall & pelvic floor is a strategic choice in pregnancy training. \n\nSo what does that mean? \n\nIt means, what is safe for you is going to be determined by: \n\n👉🏽 your fitness level, core strength & experience \n👉🏽 your connection to your deep core, pelvic floor, and breath\n👉🏽your ability to manage and disperse pressure in the core. (There’s different breath strategies to do this. My core guide goes over it)\n\nWhen to modify: \n👉🏽 If the lift requires breath holding, valsalva, or straining, reduce weight. \n👉🏽 If you see coning or belly shape changes due to pressure of the lift even after trying different breathing  strategies or alignment changes, reduce the weight. \n👉🏽Any leaking or heaviness during OR after your session indicates it was too stressful on the system. \n👉🏽Pain. Seems obvious but sometimes ppl gaslight themselves into thinking “it’s way easier than I used to do, I’m fine”\n\nThis doesn’t mean you cannot challenge yourself! There are so many ways to continue training and working hard without risking injury during or after to your body. Think longevity! Your body will thank you.\n\nI have an in depth guide built with pelvic floor therapist that go into great detail on all of this!"""

Seeing our boys so excited leading up to this moment and our friends eager to find out for months and sharing it with everyone, wouldn’t change a thing.🫶🏽\n\nI got super emotional because I had a spiritual moment with this baby (before I even knew I was pregnant) that I only opened up to a few about and it was UNREAL seeing that moment I had was REAL rather than a figment of my subconscious imagination.

general,"""“Whatever you did pre-pregnancy, you can continue”…Yes, but there’s more nuances to this recommendation 🙏🏼\n\nAs baby grows, your pelvic floor takes on an additional load and your abdominal muscles will split to create room for baby. This is a part of the process! You can’t avoid it.\n\nThis makes your abdominal wall & pelvic floor more prone to pressure and potential injury.\n\nDoing exercises that cause a lot of downward pressure and major coning is a repetitive stress to those structures. Especially if it’s something done daily & with intensity.\n\nInjuries like prolapse, incontinence, hernias and severe DR can become a much bigger issue to navigate and heal postpartum.\n\nThis doesn’t mean we shouldn’t move, or FEAR exercising. Quite the opposite.\n\nIt just gives us a better frame of strategic training during pregnancy to allow for the positive benefits of exercises WITH the easiest recovery postpartum given the circumstances we’re in!\n\nFor more in depth education and guidance on all of this,  check out my core guide!\n\n#fitpregnancy #pregnancyworkout #diastasisrecti"""

general,"""What’s something you were told you can’t do with DR!? \n\nHealing DR can be frustrating. There’s so many different “rules” out there & it can make it confusing on what you can & can’t do.\n\nThere’s appropriate exercises to do be doing at different stages in your DR healing journey.👏🏼\n\nThe key in ALL stages, is progressive OVERLOAD. \n\nYou have to challenge & load the connective tissues & muscles with enough stimulus, so a physiological response occurs in the tissues and muscles.\n\nThis is where most individuals find a stall in their progress.\n\nThey’re afraid of “making it worse” and in turn, halt progress because they aren’t challenging the system enough, while avoiding important muscle groups like the “six pack muscle.”\n\nYour deep core works with ALL the superficial core muscles. They are a TEAM. Lifting is a great way to challenge your core as a whole.\n\nYes, exercise selection & intentional movement within exercises is important. Yes, being aware if the exercise is too much or just right is also important. However, your body is pretty cool, resilient and will give you feedback on if it’s too much. \n\nMy Core guide will teach you all of this. Link in bio.\n\nLastly, TIME.

general,"""When I saw the forecast was below freezing at night and above 40 degrees during the day I got so excited! Been planning on doing this for ages! And of course the morning I woke up to tap the trees it had snowed😅 I used a big leaf maple tree for this. It doesn’t taste the same as a sugar maple but still very tasty! Tapping a tree correctly does not harm it, you can plug the hole back up with a branch, but the tree also is able to heal itself perfectly. I ended up using sap from 3 different trees here on our property, and I plan on making more later this week! I will be posting a video on YouTube in a couple days about this and other things I’ve been up to :) see you all soon! Xx"""

These past months for me have been filled with hope and excitement, but also a lot of sadness and tears. A time of change, and growth, and letting go of old things that don’t serve us anymore."""
general,"""At night is when I feel most at home. Lately life’s been staying up late deep in the mountains and sleeping in until the sun is high in the sky and the air is warm. This is the time of year when I really start to get tired of the cold, so my solution is sleeping through the morning when it’s the coldest😂. It’s still freezing at night and I check the weather every day to see when I can finally plant my little starts outside in the garden"""

general,"""I think about this trip so often. I love the ocean more than anything else. maybe because some of my favorite memories as a child were at the ocean, we would take camping trips there every summer and set up the tent on the beach and spend a full week there. It was always really cold because here in Washington it doesn’t really get that warm on the coast, even in summer. So we would swim all day then huddle next to the fire and drink hot cocoa, sand would be everywhere. Being at the ocean feels like home to me"""

I was scared of taking a risk, I was scared of trying something different, of challenging myself, of taking a different path. And that fear paralyzed me. I think we all live with some amount of fear, but I’ve started to realize that when we do the things that scare us, it can lead to the most amount of growth. And without realizing it, when we start facing our fears, we start moving forward again.\nThank you guys for being on this journey with me, I’m excited to see where this year takes me:-)"""

general,"""I have taken some time off of filming this month, and of course there is a part of me that feels really bad about myself. It’s hard for me to take a break sometimes when I constantly feel like I’m not doing enough. How do I justify taking a break when I already feel so behind?\n\nBut also, this break has been the most incredible thing. It’s given me a chance to really look at my life with more perspective, and figure out where I want to put my energy this next season, and this next year. We can get so lost in working and moving and doing, but sometimes we need to ask ourselves “where and I heading?” \n“Is this work that I’m doing leading me to where I ultimately want to go?” \n\nI realized during this break that I have a lot of goals, but I’m not actually doing things everyday that will help me get to my goals.\n\nSometimes we can feel lost, like we don’t know what direction to go, and sometimes the answer can be as simple as resting. Taking a break can help us see with better perspective what’s truly important to us, it can help us be more intentional with our time, to do the things that help move us forward in life. \n\nI’ll be posting a video this Sunday about what I’ve been doing this past month, sorry for being so distant. Love you all, see you in a couple days:) \n\n-isabel"""

But don’t loose hope you guys. Because as much as we feel like we are powerless against the giant forces of this world, I think love can heal all the broken. And though it feels like everything is falling apart, tomorrow is a new day, the sun will rise despite everything, the trees will change color, the stars will shine, and maybe we don’t know how many days we have left, but to me that doesn’t have to be sad, that can be beautiful, because it forces us to ask ourselves, what will we do with the precious days we have here on this earth?"""

Such an elegant plant 😍\n\nAlocasias aren't the easiest plants to look after, but when provided the right conditions, they're just such beautiful plants. Their roots are quite thin, so they're quite susceptable to root rot. However, they don't like to dry out too much either, so it's a tricky balance. To see whether they're due a watering, I like to pick up the pot to see if it's light. I also bottom-water them, and remove any excess water that would remain in the plate after an hour.\n\nKeep in mind, for alocasias to thrive, they also require bright, indirect light, so save your best windows for them 😊\n.\n.\n#alocasia  #plantguttation #indoorplants #frydek #plantsofinstagram #foliageplant #plantsmakepeoplehappy #houseplantsofinstagram #urbanjungle #foliageplants #ihavethisthingwithplants #house_plant_community #houseofplantlovers  #plantstagram #houseplantclub #plantstyling #houseplantcommunity  #plantparentcommunity #plantssparkjoy #plantaholics #guttation #babyplnts"""

general,"""World Mental Health Day 💚\n\nLast year was a massive rollercoaster for me. I probably hit the lowest points in my mental health. It was also the year I went \""public\"" with my struggles through @trudy_kerr_interviewer 's podcast, and the year that I started to work properly towards getting my life back.\n\nI used to suffer terribly from health anxiety, and somehow, even though it may seem unrelated, social anxiety also reared its head. On top of fearing different types of health issues, I had really low self-esteem, and even going out for a swim or going to a spa was terribly daunting for me. It also pretty much put my life to a halt. I would travel and feel physically sick with anxiety (to the point that I couldn't eat which then fuelled thoughts of \""is something wrong with me??\""). I couldn't think about building a family because I felt I could barely cope as it was. And I was so fed up of feeling like that.\n\nI sought therapy, I spoke out to friends and family and found the support I needed. I became more comfortable with myself and my body, and I stopped letting the intrusive thoughts take over. Going public also helped just because so many people who felt they were in the same boat reached out...and when you realise you're not alone, things start to feel a little better.\n\nWithin months, I am probably the best, and happiest version of myself, with a thriving little one.\n\nTrust me when I say: Things do get better. I've had those feelings - like you're in a deep, dark tunnel with no way out in sight. But there is a way out. And it's so bright. And life can be so good. Please seek help if you need it 💚\n.\n.\n#worldmentalhealthday #mentalhealth #mentalhealthawareness #worldmentalhealthawarenessday"""

general,"""One of the most common questions I get - why are water droplets forming on my plants?\n\nPERSEPHONE - my gorgeous #PinkPrincessPhilodendron here to remind you that 'guttation' is not usually something you should worry about.\n\nSo, why does it happen?\nGuttation happens when you would have recently watered a plant, and mostly happens at night. The roots build up pressure, to be able to push up the water from the soil to the leaves. Sometimes water is physically squeezed out of the tips of the plants, due to that pressure, and maybe a slight excess of water. It looks super weird and unnatural but it's completely normal and harmless.\n\nHOWEVER!!! And I can't stress this enough - STILL you must be careful of not overwatering your plants. It is better to let your plants dry out between waterings, than to overwater. Plants will easily bounce back from slight under watering, bit once you over-water and all the roots are rotten, unless you manage to propagate in time, chances are you'll lose the plant.\n\nMy point is, seeing guttation doesn't mean you overwatered a plant. But an overwatered plant can show guttation before the roots rot. 😊.\n.\n.\n#philodendron #philodendronpinkprincess #pinkprincess #plantguttation #indoorplants #pinkplant #plantsofinstagram #foliageplant #plantsmakepeoplehappy #houseplantsofinstagram #urbanjungle #foliageplants #ihavethisthingwithplants #house_plant_community #houseofplantlovers  #plantstagram #houseplantclub #plantstyling #houseplantcommunity  #plantparentcommunity #plantssparkjoy #plantaholics #guttation #babyplnts"""

You should constantly check and clean your foliage, cause these 💩💩💩 are relentless.\n\nWhat I'm doing to control the outbreaks:\n1) Cutting off all leaves when I spot them. If roots are healthy, plants can bounce back from that.\n2) I use Resolva (an insecticide) which is a lifesaver (literally, it saves my plants' lives 🤣 Don't use outside cause it's harmful to bees though!)\n3) Checking any plants that were neighbouring daily, in case they also got infected\n4) If it's not a plant that's worth the hassle - I chuck it lol. I had gotten rid of my Brazil philodendron. Too much foliage, not enough time to keep on top of it.\n5) Quarantine infested plants if you have the space\n\n.\n#alocasia #alocasiayucatanprincess #yucatanprincess #plantpests  #plantobsession  #plantgang #botanicalwomen  #planthaul  #ihavethisthingwithplants\n #velvetplant #crazyplantlady #velvetyplants #crazyplantmom #botanicalgirl #plantlove #plantlovercommunity #plantlady  #plantmagic  #plantmom #talkplantytome #plantsmakepeoplehappy #plantssparkjoy #house_plant_community #houseofplantlovers #houseplantclub #foliageplants #thrips"""

general,"""I love a good teaching opportunity. Just because the top of the soil looks dry, doesn't mean the plant needs watering.\n.\n.\nOverwatering is probably the number 1 killer of plants.\n\nObviously, since the top of the soil is exposed to light and heat, more than the bottom is, you may think the plant is thirsty, because the soil may look dry on top. But beneath the surface, it might be well-quenched. \n\nAdding more water to already wet soil will only increase the chances of it becoming muddy, and thus suffocating and rotting the roots, especially if it's not a well-draining mixture.\n\nTips to checking if the plant needs watering:\n1)Keep a mental tab (or an excel sheet, app, whatever 😂) of when you last watered. My average is watering plants, once every 2 weeks, unless they're in tiny pots or in terracotta (plants in tiny pots and in terracotta dry out faster).\n\n2)Feel the weight of the pot. If it's super light, might be time to water.\n\n3)Look at the foliage. Some plants show you signs like folding, shriveling, drooping.\n\n4)Put your finger deep in the soil, or use a kebab stick to see if they come out moist/wet. Finger method is usually my go-to (so many \""That's what she said\"" joke potentials, I know).\n\n5)I don't suggest you pull out the plant from the pot, so as not to disturb the roots. I only do that if I know the plant is rootbound and can handle it, like Priscilla can.\n\n6)Keep in mind in colder seasons plants need less watering.\n\nWhat other tips do you guys have, for knowing when to water a plant?\n\nP.S. My personal take on  water metres: I don't trust them 🤷 I only trust my god-given water meter - my finger 🤣🤣👆\n\n.\n.\n#philodendronlover #philodendron #planttips #rootporn  #plantobsession  #plantgang #botanicalwomen  #planthaul  #ihavethisthingwithplants\n #wateringtips #crazyplantlady #wateringplants #crazyplantmom #botanicalgirl #plantlove #plantlovercommunity #plantlady  #plantmagic  #plantmom #talkplantytome #plantsmakepeoplehappy #plantssparkjoy #house_plant_community #houseofplantlovers"""

general,"""|AD - @lechuza_malta 's self-watering planters to the rescue! ✨\n\nSend a message @lechuza_malta to order your own self-watering pot (with a plant included if you wish!). There's hundreds of styles, sizes and colours to choose from 😊 Perfect Christmas gifts or Secret Santa gifts too! \n\n-\nPlants don't need too much maintenance to survive. They simply require adequate light and watering. But whilst finding them a bright spot is relatively easy, watering them adequately can be super tricky.\n\nIf the soil gets too soggy and muddy, or the plant sits in water for too long, the roots will rot. And once the roots rot, there's really no going back from it! The @lechuza_malta uses a simple but effective method to water your plants overtime, evenly! The pots have a small reservoir at the bottom that you fill. The water is siphoned up with ropes into the soil, distributing it evenly so that all roots get a good amount of water without the soil becoming soggy. And you have a little marker in red that shows you when the reservoir is empty, and needs to be refilled!\n\nNo more guessing! 😊So if you've got a black thumb, or a relatively green thumb but too many plants to keep up with (like me 😂) these pots are perfect for you 😊\n\n-\n@lechuza_malta pots are also available at: Playmobil Funpark, Callus Garden Centre, Il-Qronfla, Stella's garden centre, Plantastic, Flower Zone nursery (Gozo), Almar pet and garden (Gozo), Tropical forest (Gozo).\n\n.\n.\n#overwatering #planttips #crazyplantlady #crazyplantpeople #monstera #lechuza #lechuzaplanters #monsteradeliciosa #monsteramonday #philodendronpinkprincess #philodendron #plants #plantsplantsplants #indoorplants #houseplants"""

general,"""Sharing this because a lot of you (and I mean A LOT) commented on how they can also get shiny leaves on their plants.\n\nNew leaves always tend to be a bit shinier (plus there's a window right across this plant which accentuates the shininess). Over time, the colour of the leaves becomes darker and more muted. \n\nThere are these 'oils' that claim to give leaves a shine but I don't recommend them because they will block the pores of the leaves. Every now and then it's good to clean the leaves with a little bit of water, particularly large leaves like those of the Monstera, as they accumulate dust, which would hinder photosynthesis. Otherwise just let them be and give them plenty of light so you see plenty of new shiny leaves ☺️"""

(I'm happy to talk about this further, and share my experiences too!)\n\n-I work in HR and I champion well-being\n\n-I'm a major geek, love playing video games, reading fantasy books and grew up lost in the world of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.\n\n-I'm a wife\n\n-My parents are my heroes. My dad had a stroke a few years ago and his will and determination to live life to the fullest is admirable. My mother's dedication and care to our family is unmatched.\n\n-I had a small business throughout my university years so supporting small and local is very important to me.\n\n-I love clothes.\n\n-I have a massive gel nail polish collection 💅\n\n-I hate exercising (and this is something I am severely challenged with as I try to be the best version of myself).\n\n-CATS!\n\n-I have 3 brothers\n\n-I hate cooking but like sharing the final result when I do make a decent meal - keeps me motivated 😂\n\n-I want to make the best impact I possibly can through this platform.\n\nI'm so excited for this new adventure. But don't worry. You'll still get to see a lot of plants too, my babies aren't going anywhere ❤️\n\nThank you to all of you who encouraged me to do this. I genuinely have one of the most supportive communities, and this is why I think through this platform, so much more can be achieved, to support each other.\n\nWould you like to share what you'd like to see more of?"""

Many of the hybrid varieties continue to show strong resilience, too, and we anticipate a more regular hybrid crop this year. \n\nThe warm and favorable weather this summer season has accelerated ripening, putting us ahead of average for this time of year.
